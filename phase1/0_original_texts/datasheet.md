## COMPOSITION

What do the instances that comprise the dataset
represent (e.g. documents, photos, people, countries)?
Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users,
and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes
and edges)? Please provide a description.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

How many instances are there in total (of each type,
if appropriate)?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Does the dataset contain all possible instances or
is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances
from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what
is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger
set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how

this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not
representative of the larger set, please describe why not
(e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because
instances were withheld or unavailable).

YOUR ANSWER HERE

What data does each instance consist of? “Raw”
data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either
case, please provide a description.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Is there a label or target associated with each
instance? If so, please provide a description.
YOUR ANSWER HERE

Is any information missing from individual instances?
If so, please provide a description, explaining why this
information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable).
This does not include intentionally removed information,
but might include, e.g., redacted text.
YOUR ANSWER HERE

Are relationships between individual instances made
explicit (e.g., users? movie ratings, social network links)?
If so, please describe how these relationships are made
explicit.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training,
development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a
description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind
them.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies
in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.
YOUR ANSWER HERE

Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or
otherwise rely on external resources (e.g, websites,
tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external
resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and
remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival
versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external
resources as they existed at the time the dataset was
created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees)
associated with any of the external resources that might
apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all
external resources and any restrictions associated with them,
as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.
YOUR ANSWER HERE

confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege
or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes
the content of individuals? non-public communications)?

Subpopulations are identified and provide a description of
their respective distributions within the dataset.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in
combination with other data) from the dataset? If so,
please describe how.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

considered sensitive in any way (e.g, data that reveals
racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious
beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or
locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic
data; forms of government identification, such as social
security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide
a description.

## COLLECTION

How was the data associated with each instance
acguired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text,
movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses),
or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-
speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If
data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived

from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so,
please describe how.
YOUR ANSWER HERE

Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does
this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data
associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news
articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the
data associated with the instances was created. Finally, list
when the dataset was first published.

YOUR ANSWER HERE

What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect
the data (e.g, hardware apparatus or sensor, manual
human curation, software program, software APD?
How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?
YOUR ANSWER HERE

What was the resource cost of collecting the data?
(e.g. what were the reguired computational resources, and
the associated financial costs, and energy consumption -
estimate the carbon footprint. See Strubell ef al.[2| for
approaches in this area.)

YOUR ANSWER HERE

the sampling strategy (e.g. deterministic, probabilistic
with specific sampling probabilities)?
YOUR ANSWER HERE

compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

screenshots or other information) how notice was provided,
