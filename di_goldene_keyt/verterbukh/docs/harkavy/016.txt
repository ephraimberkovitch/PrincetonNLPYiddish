Yiddish, for those seeking equivalents for the English vocabulary of modern
science and technology, and for those desiring guidance on the attitudes of
American Yiddish normativists toward a given item. For the last decade or so,
however, the disappearance of Harkavy’s trilingual dictionary from the market
has been painful for more advanced students of the language requiring a more
exhaustive coverage of the language of the nineteenth and twentieth century
masters of modern Yiddish literature and a dictionary that is more descriptively
oriented.

The student of Yiddish can supplement both Harkavy and Weinreich with the
first four volumes of Yudel Mark’s unabridged Yiddish-Yiddish defining dic-
tionary, the Groyser verterbukh fun der yidisher shprakh (“Great Dictionary of
the Yiddish Language,” Joffe and Mark 1961; 1966; Mark 1971; 1980). The fourth
volume reaches only to the end of the first letter of the Yiddish alphabet, alef.
Still, they include far more of the Yiddish lexicon than a single letter of the
alphabet might imply. They contain virtually most the verbs of Yiddish, in
consequence of the large number of verbal prefixes beginning with alef; hence
the inclusion of most verbs under one or more of their prefixed forms. Further, a
disproportionately large part of Yiddish vocabulary begins with the letter alef
by virtue of the seven vowels and diphthongs (a, ay, ey, 1, 0, oy, u) system-
atically marked or preceded by that letter at the beginning of a word. Prepa-
ration of additional volumes continues (see Moskovich and Wolf 1981).

Harkavy’s Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary appeared in New York in
1925 and with a supplement in 1928. It was reissued many times thereafter by
the Hebrew Publishing Company. The present reprint is a reproduction of the
1928 edition, with no further changes or corrections. The Yiddish student will
have no difficulty in coping with the minor orthographic variations between this
dictionary and the YIVO system employed in Uriel Weinreich’s dictionary.

Because of its inherent simplicity and straightforwardness, there is no more
need now for an elaborate guide to using the dictionary than there was in 1925. It
is a book to be picked up and used as is, with its wealth and its blemishes. The
extensive lexicographic coverage is enhanced by many of the pleasures long
enjoyed by several generations of readers.

Harkavy’s etymologies are often daring and sometimes shaky but usually
enlightening and always delightful. See, for example, the entries on akhberosh
(p. 348); avekleygn dem tatn (p. 233); bahavnt (p. 102); baln (p. 113);
