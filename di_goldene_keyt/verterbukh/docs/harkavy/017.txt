supplement p. 564); terakh (p. 524); (nemen af) tsihunder (p. 426); toyte

The dictionary includes a charming sprinkling of Old Yiddish, comprising
archaic words and usages as well as taytsh words derived from the centuries-old
tradition of phrase-by-phrase translation from sacred Hebrew or Aramaic texts
into Yiddish. See as examples the entries for bizkl, bizkn, bizkele “until, as far
as” (p. 118); braylaf, brayleft “wedding” (p. 134); federn tmetsn sholem “be first
in greeting a person” (p. 411); hinerplet “lethargy” (p. 198); kern “bride, bride-
groom,” rather than the usual “capital/principal, fund” (p. 468); lindvorem
“winged dragon, flying serpent” (p. 277); and vidmenen “swarm” (p. 205). From
East European Jewish folklore Harkavy brings such items as banemung
“earrying away (of a child) by ademon” (p. 107) and optsug “self examination of a
woman before coition” (p. 78). He notes that khiber—normally “composition,
treatise, (arithmetic) addition” also meant “literary (rather than literal) trans-
lation” in Old Yiddish, i.e., one that preserved the syntax of
the translation language—shiber in the sense of “interconnection of the
words” (p. 551).

Harkavy relishes such Lower East Side evolutions as afodern “afford” (p. 70);
datl du “that'll do” (p. 544); endostn “endorse” (p. 566); eyer tsum yuzn “eggs to
use for smearing or mixing with dough but not for cooking or baking” (p. 554);
hobn a gud taym “have a good time” (p. 583); hor yop “hurry up” (p. 547);
kakerutsh bos “small employer,” noting that it occurs among Jewish union
workers (p. 576); peyde “salary” (p. 368); poketbukh “pocketbook” (p. 362); to-let
“sign that says to let [for rent]” (p. 551); sanovegon “son of a gun,” which is cross-
referenced to sanovebitsh (p. 561); and tsomis “summons,” credited to Yiddish
in England (p. 415). In the 1928 addendum, Harkavy (p. 531) introduces
supralinear diacritics to mark Yiddish d’s that correspond with English th, as in
clothing, and Yiddish ?t’s that match English th in nothing, to help the immi-
grants spell English correctly. At the same time, he recognized these items as
parts of the linguistic system of American Yiddish, and he tells the reader, in
the same paragraph, to pronounce “plain d and t” in Yiddish.

Nowhere perhaps is Harkavy’s unique ability to balance the need for Amer-
icanization with Yiddishist loyalty as evident as in the list of Yiddish names and
their recommended English-language equivalents (pp. 525-30). To “gentilizers”
of children’s names he gives the options of biblical equivalents (Avrom/ Abra-
ham) or “translative equivalents” (Zelig/Felix). Unlike just about all other
“Americanizers,” however, Harkavy gives the option (which barely got off the
ground in American Jewry) of providing anglicized spellings of Yiddish names
themselves (Alter, Charna, Kalman, Lippa, Malla, Sheftl, and Trytl). He often
gives Yiddish names in American spelling, with the historical English or trans-
lative option following in parenthesis: Glicka (Felicia, Beatrice, p. 526), Sander
(Alexander, p. 529), Shprintza (Hope, p. 530), Tryna (Catherine, p. 527) and
Zlatta (Aurelia, p. 527).

There is a considerable corpus of material on dialects. Within the realm of
