In 1887 Harkavy took up a post as a Hebrew teacher in Montreal, where he
published a single issue of Canada’s first Yiddish newspaper, Di tsayt. This was
followed in 1890 by Der yidisher progres in Baltimore, of which nine issues
appeared. He worked from 1904 to 1909 for HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society) at its Ellis Island office, teaching American history and the United
States Constitution in Yiddish for the New York City Board of Education. In
1919 he was appointed a lecturer in older Yiddish literature and Yiddish gram-
mar at New York’s Yiddish Teachers’ Seminary. Harkavy was also an active
participant in the world of contemporary Yiddish literature and literary crit-
icism (see Niger 1973, 279, 292; Ravitsh 1980, 198-200; Shulman 1979, 123, 457).
During his many creative years in New York, he wrote a large number of
educational books and pamphlets, most of which were published by the Hebrew
Publishing Company.

The primary bibliography for Harkavy, as for almost any Yiddish writer of
the period, is Zalmen Reyzen’s Leksikon (1926-29, 1:794-808; see also
Tshubinski 1960). A separate bibliography was compiled by the American
Section of YIVO (1933). Harkavy’s works fall into a number of categories. First
are those on the Yiddish language which seek to bolster its standing (see YIVO
1988, 8-9, and as samples Harkavy 1886; 1894-95; 1896; 1906). The largest
corpus consists of works which helped educate and acculturate millions of
Jewish immigrants in America. This aspect of his career was launched by the
five volumes (1895-1900) of the Amerikanisher folks-kalendar (“The American
Folk Calendar”), which were miscellanies of information on everything from
American politics to dentistry. They were followed over the decades by dozens
of grammars and guides to letter writing in English; books on American,
Jewish, and world history, as well as geography, physics, arithmetic, and
modern Hebrew; translations of world literature; and revised editions of the Old
Testament in Yiddish and English (see YIVO 1938, 10-14). Whether he was
translating Don Quixote into Yiddish or compiling a new dictionary, Harkavy
sought to educate the immigrant Jews of America with authentic renditions, not
the hackwork so common in those years. Then there were the scholarly articles
on a variety of subjects, but especially Yiddish linguistics and folklore (see
YIVO 1933, 8-11, and as samples Harkavy 1895; 1901; 1924). Harkavy also edited
a number of pivotal New York Yiddish literary anthologies which helped launch
serious Yiddish literature on the East Side around the turn of the century (see
Shulman 1979, 421-436), including ten issues of Der nayer gayst (“The New
Spirit”) in 1897 and 1898 and Der tsvantsikster yorhundert (“The Twentieth
Century”) in 1900. Finally, Harkavy published a substantial series of bilingual

‘dictionaries starting with his 1891 English-Yiddish Dictionary and his 1898
Yiddish-English Dictionary.

Some strands of Harkavy’s lifework have always appeared ambiguous to
partisans of any particular twentieth-century Jewish cultural movement. How
did it come to pass that the great Americanizer who published dozens of
