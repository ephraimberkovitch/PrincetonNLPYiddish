division is fortuitous, being due to the
placement of material in this text. If
the word were to occur in the middle of
a line, it would therefore be spelled
‏יניט-דערזאָגנדיק‎

On hyphenation in compound nouns,
see also §§ 5a25 and 5b14.

d. Stress

1. In an unhyphenated Yid. word,
the vowel on which the main stress
falls is in this Dictionary marked by
the symbol ' to the left of the corre-
sponding letter. For example, yiyw'yp
is to be read as ‏ניטאָ' ;(מאממ3'מאן‎ 15 0
be read as [NITO’]. If no stress symbol
appears, the stress is understood to fall
on the next-to-last vowel, or on the
only vowel of the word. Thus, puxoy
is to be read as if it were written
p’o'owh, i.e. [GRA-MA’-TIK]. (Regard-
ing stress indications in transcribed
words of Hebrew-Aramaic origin, see
§ 4f11.)

The stress symbol is used here as
an aid to the learner of the language.
It is not employed in the ordinary
Yid. orthography.

Note that [N L M] appearing after a
consonant at the end of a word, or
between two consonants, form syl-
Jables and are included in the syllable
count. E.g. in pom! the stress
is marked as falling on the first syl-
lable because of the following syllabifi-
cation: [vi’N-TL-DIK]; contrariwise, the
stress need not be marked in orbyyn,
as it falls on the next-to-last syllable:
[RE-A-LI’-ZM].

2. Concerning placement of stress in
complemented verbs, see § 5c15.

3. The place of stress is indicated
only within words. The most heavily

 

due to the conservatism of editors or
to technical deficiencies of typewriters,
printing shops, etc. These deviations
are relatively minor for the reader who
knows Yid., but can be troublesome
for the learner of the language. In
using this Dictionary on texts written
in unstandardized spelling, three hints
may be particularly useful:

the diacritic marks in 3, ‏ײַ‎ 3, 5, »,
and ‏ת‎ 216 sometimes omitted;

the letter 1 [B] is sometimes written
3;

a superfluous y is sometimes written
before final 5 or ] to mark their
syllabicity.

The non-standard use of apostrophes
and the irregular separation and hy-
phenation of compounds, common in
non-standard spelling, are unlikely to
cause difficulty in looking up words in
this Dictionary.

c. Word Division

Fortuitous divisions of cited Yid.
words, resulting from the lack of space
in a particular line of this Dictionary,
are marked by light horizontal bars
near the center of the line (- ). On the
other hand, hyphens which are part of
the Yid. orthography are indicated by
normal heavy hyphens aligned with
the tops of the letters (-). For
example:

guarded (speech) -ayt y's ,pdwad'yn
‏זאָ גנריק‎

The hyphen between ‏ד 4220 ט‎ 38
that the word is always to be hy-
phenated at that point. On the other
hand, the light horizontal bar after 7
indicates that the word is here con-
tinued on the next line, but that the
