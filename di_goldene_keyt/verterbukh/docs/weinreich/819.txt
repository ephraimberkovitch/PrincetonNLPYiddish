c. Verbs

1. In YE each verb is identified by
the symbol » after the entry word. In
EY the same symbol marks the place
in idiomatic phrases where an ap-
propriately inflected verb form is to be

endings to the stem ‏;שטערסט ,שטער)‎

3. The marking or non-marking of
stress is based on the accentuation of

shift in the conjugation. Thus, from
the infinitive ]|7wrNo (stressed on the
next-to-last syllable, i. e. [MAR-shi’-RN])
are fcrmed the inflected forms 7w7yo,
‏.מאַרשי'רט 206 , מאַרשי'רסט‎

Enc. ADJECTIVES MATCHED
By Yip. Nouns

13. A certain number of Eng. ad-
jectives (including adjunct nouns; cf.
§ 5a29) is matched in Yid. by nouns
which appear as modifying elements
in a compound. Such Yid. nouns are
followed by three dots. Ex.:

nocturnal ‏נאַכט...‎

Thus, ‘nocturnal song’ would be
‏(ליד == 5009') נאַכטליד‎ , 640.

‘14, Elements of compounds are
listed with a hyphen if the compound
is always hyphenated (by the rules
summarized in §5a25). Ex.:

instrumental ‏אינסטרומענטאַ'לי...‎

This means that any compound into
which 'xmynrqwore enters is hyphen-
ated. On the other hand, if a noun
component of a compound is listed
without a hyphen, the hyphenation or
non-hyphenation of the compound is
determined by the rules summarized
in § 5a25. E.g. the notation
