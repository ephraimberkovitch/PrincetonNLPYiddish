2. Arrangement of Yiddish-English Part (YE)

hostile, adverse -w woyn'yp
@ >< -0

3. A subentry is ordinarily separated
from the preceding material by the
symbol ||. The following simplified
example illustrates the order in which
the material should be read:

blind j{>¥0 ‘3 {| blind ‏בלינד יי‎
o> <-——@ || > —O

4, If there is not enough room in a
line for the completion of an Eng.
word or word-sequence, the Eng. ma-
terial is continued on the right of the
next line. For example:

torment; labor, pains; (}) ‏מאַ'שערניש דאָס‎

© : ©
hardship
@—

5. If the Eng. word or word-se-
quence thus completed is followed by
another Yid. subentry, the Eng. ma-
terial is separated from the new
subentry by the symbol +. This
symbol therefore means that whatever
appears to the right of it should be
read first, as it forms the completion
of the preceding line. Ex.:

look, glance, gaze; )|( ‏בליק ער‎

@— >< —@)

 

a. Alphabetic Order of Entries

1. The order of letters in the Yid.
alphabet, as specified in the standard-
ized orthography, is shown in the
table on p. xxi. Note that for pur-
poses of alphabetization, the letters x,
s, and § are considered one; similarly
> and :, as well as» and x. Thus, 240
precedes jwxn since 1 comes before w;
on the other hand, yy precedes yy0,
since the only distinction here is be-
tween ¥ and x.

In the rare cases of identically
spelled words with different pronuncia-
tions, the arrangement is according to
the vowels, in this order: [zero a 0 U oy
1 EY E]. Examples will be found under
“D1, 14n, 790 and others.

2. In the case of multi-word entries,
spaces are ignored in determining their
alphabetical place. Ex.: nbn precedes
‏.חל זײַן‎

b. Order Within Entries

1, Each entry begins with a Yid.
entry word, followed by grammatical
analysis and pronunciation specifica-
tions, if necessary (see § 4f and sec. 5).
If the entry runs over beyond the first
line, the further lines are indented on
the right. Many entries contain fur-
ther subentries which do not them-
selves form beginnings of new para-
graphs.

2. Where an entry is matched by
more than one Eng. equivalent, the
Eng. sequence is read from left to
right. Ex.:
