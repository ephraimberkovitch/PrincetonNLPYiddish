marked, respectively, by the symbols
o and ow. Constructions of verbs with
following adjectives (e.g. feel) are
marked by the symbol ~s.

33. In a number of cases the sub-
ject of an Eng. verb is matched by a
dative or accusative object of the
equivalent Yid. verb. This reversal of
construction is symbolized by ‘‘rev.
600. Ex.:

like (rev. con.) + }|SyByn

This means that ‘I like you’ is 7
‏,געפֿעלסט מיר‎ where the Eng. subject
‘I’ is matched by the Yid. dative
object 1», while the Eng. object ‘you’
is matched by the Yid. subject 17. -
34. In many instances the corre-
sponding Yid. verb is impersonal, as
indicated by the symbol »«. Ex.:

itch (rev. con.) == ‏לאָפּטשע|ן‎

Thus, ‘I itch’ (where ‘‘T”’ is the subject)
corresponds to Yid. 77» uywwayd oy,
where 7p is the object of an imper-
sonal verb.

35. In a few cases an Eng. ex-
pression involving two verbs corre-
sponds toa Yid. verb with a modifying
adverb or adverbial phrase. The sym-
bol » then serves as an instruction to
insert the appropriate Yid. verb in the
proper inflected form. Ex.: fail in the
sense of “not do’’ is rendered by
» 9. Thus, ‘I fail to understand it’
would correspond 10 ‏איך פֿאַרשטײ' עס ניט‎ ;
‘he failed to understand it’ would
‏;ער האָט עס ניט פֿאַרשטאַנען 10 011690006ס‎
etc.

grammar, without regard to the Eng.
translation. Ex.:

חנפֿע|נען זיך צו ‎flatter‏

In this (simplified) EY entry, the pre-
positional construction with 1 is
marked as obligatory (no brackets),
since it is needed in Yid. to match
Eng. constructions with the transitive
verb, ‘‘flatter.’’ On the other hand, in
YE the prepositional construction is
shown to be optional:

engage in flattery; (x) ‏חנפֿע|נען זיך י‎
flatter, cajole

The Eng.-speaking user of the Dic-
tionary will know when to select the
intransitive ‘‘engage in flattery’ and
when to use the transitive ‘‘flatter’’ as
the appropriate equivalent of a Yid.

31. When a Yid. verb is constructed
with another verb in the infinitive, this
is indicated by the symbol 1x, e.g.

means that ‘he made bold to ask’ is
