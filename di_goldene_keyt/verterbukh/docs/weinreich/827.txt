 

XXIV GUIDELINES

Yid. orthography is in this Dictionary
conveyed by transcriptions in square
brackets. The transcription is basically
phonemic, although some technicalities
have been overlooked for the benefit
of the general user.

2. The phonetic values of most
Latin letters used in the transcriptions
are self-explanatory. For additional
comment, see the ‘Remarks’’ column
in the table on p. xxi.

3. If the pronunciation of a word
corresponds to its spelling according
to the phonetic values of the let-
ters given in the table on p. xxi, no
transcription is provided, even if the
word is of Hebrew-Aramaic origin, e. g.
by5) (which can automatically be read
as (GVUL]), own (which can auto-
matically be read as [khushim)), etc.

4. In the case of Yid. phrases con-
sisting of several words, only the
word or words requiring transcrip-
tion are so provided with it, e.g.

[shABES] Nav OW

[KASHE ... MAYSE] TWYD 8 ‏אַ קשיא אויף‎

5. In the case of a hyphenated Yid.
word, part of which offers a pronuncia-
tion problem to the language learner,
only the part in question is pro-
vided with a transcription, e.g.

חתךמאָל (אפ'סגאן
‎stands for [kho’sNMOL],‏
לע'בער"ים (זאאצ}

stands for [LE/BERYAM]. If the main
stress falls on the transcribed segment,
as in [Kho’sn] 9yo"jnn, it is so marked; if
the untranscribed component also con-
tains the stress symbol, this designates
a subsidiary stress, e. g.

 

is pronounced [RA’D-yO] (or [RA’-D1-0]),
not [ra’-pyo]. On the other hand, the
absence of the symbol ' indicates the
palatalizing function of the ». Thus
‏פּרוטיע‎ is read [PRU’-TyE], not [PRU’T-YE]
or [PRU’-TI-E]; similarly, yu uRnyINT
is read [HO-RE-vA’-NyE], not [HO-RE-
VA'N-YE] Or [HO-RE-VA’-NI-E].

(iv) In a few instances where the
symbol ' is required as a sign of the
place of stress, yet the word contains
a post-stress palatal consonant, this
is indicated by transcription. Thus
‏האַ'רצעניו {עאן‎ means that the word is
pronounced [HA’R-TSE-NyU].

5. Palatality unmarked by *

(i) In a few words in which the
letters » and 3 alone, occurring before
other consonants or at the ends of
words, represent palatal consonants,
this fact is marked by transcription.
Thus, [Ny] yp2"7 means that the word
is pronounced [DI'Ny-KE], 04 ‏-א זסן‎
KE].

(ii) In a great many words, mostly
of “international” origin, the letter >
of the orthography stands for [Ly]
rather than [L], even though it is not
followed by ». To indicate the widely
favored palatal pronunciation of such
instances of 5, this Dictionary uses a
diacritic symbol, 4. Thus, ms stands
for (PLyus] (not [PLUS]); yp2’Bw stands
for (shpi’Ly-KE] (not [shpi’L-KE]); etc.

Note that this diacritic is a teaching
device introduced here as an aid to the
learner of the language. It 1s not used
an the ordinary Yid. orthography.
