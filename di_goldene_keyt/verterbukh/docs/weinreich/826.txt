the transcription under gruffness and
indicates that the stem transcribed
there recurs in the adjective. The
adjective in its entirety is therefore
read [RU’GZEDIK].

9. For details on the transcription
of plurals, see 8 5412.

10. Where a series of words contains
a recurrent element requiring tran-
scription, only the novel part of each
word in the series is transcribed.
Thus,

מלאיכּעס {4'45א-18נסזאן, מלאירציחה
(פמא נפנ'פאן, מלא-חמה (פאע'ממאן

is an abbreviation for

[MOLE- ‏מלא"כּעס (4'45 א-1.8סזאן, מלא-רציחה‎
[MOLE-KhE’YME] 7orndo ,RETSI/KhE]

11. In unhyphenated transcriptions,
the place of the main stress is marked
by the symbol ’ immediately following
the stressed vowel, e. g. [kha’SENE]. If
no symbol appears, the stress is under-
stood to fall on the next-to-last vowel,
or on the sole vowel of the word; e. g.
[NEShOME] stands for [NESho’ME].

12, In hyphenated transcriptions,
the place of the main stress is marked
by the symbol’. The segment of the
hyphenated transcription which is not
marked by this symbol is understood
to have an optional, usually less strong
stress on its own next-to-last syllable
(or on its sole syllable, if it has only
one). E.g. [ToyREs-Mo’ysheE], which
has the main stress on [MO’y], is often
pronounced with another (somewhat
weaker) stress on [TO’y].

 

דרשה"נעשאַ'נק 5881'ס8פן

stands for [pRo’shE-GEsha NK].

6. In the case of Yid. words con-
taining a prefix or a sufhx separated
by |, only the stem is transcribed
(if a transcription is required at all);
e.g. [PATER] ]|70B|py stands for
[OP-PATER-N]. On prefixes and suffixes,
see also §§ 5c8, 14.

7. The repetition of transcriptions is
avoided if the same stem already ap-
pears in transcription later in the same
entry, or in a closely adjacent entry.
In such cases the empty brackets, [ ],
mean: for the pronunciation, look be-
low in the same entry, or in a closely
neighboring entry.

If a word has been provided with a
transcription in an entry, subsequent
recurrences of the word within the
same entry are not transcribed, and the
use of empty brackets is also dis-
pensed with. See, for ex., the tran-
scription of mw at its first occurrence
under leave and its untranscribed
recurrence within the same entry.

8 Occasionally a derivative form
appears with the symbol [ ] referring
to the stem form in an adjacent entry.
This means that the derivational suffix
or prefix, or the added part of the
compound, may be read according to
the usual phonetic values of the letters
(as in the table on p. xxi) and with-
out any adjustment in stress. Ex.:

בייזלעך, רוזהדיק || 6טזע
די רוגזה {(022טג| ‎gruffness‏

The notation [] under gruff refers to
