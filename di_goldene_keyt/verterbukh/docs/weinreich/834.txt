masculine noun (wv) and as an adjec-
tive (~¥) meaning ‘rye’. For 6
significance of the respelling | 7p, see
§ 5b4.

3. In the citation of Yid. phrases,
repetition is avoided by abbreviating
the entry word (if it is three or more
letters long) by means of an apostro-
phe. In the following simplified ex-
amples, '7 stands for myn and ‏א'ן‎
‎stands ‏.אוינן זס!‎

האַנט ײ (הענט) מג ,8480 || צו דער ה'
‎handy; available‏

אוינ הא )( 696 || קוק|ן מיט א'ן ‎keep a‏
‎sharp lookout‏

4. In general it has seemed most
helpful to list a phrase under the word
which has the more surprising equiva-
lent in the corresponding Eng. phrase.
Thus, vypyuyn yayt'er — literally ‘silk
gloves’ but idiomatically equivalent to
Eng. ‘kid gloves’— appears under
jw. If a phrase is not found in the
entry for one of its component words,
it may be listed under another com-
ponent. Thus, the meaning of 71"
D'NTNA DMN is not given under wy), but
it will be found under ‏-באַראָ'ש‎

Where they may be helpful, appro-
priate cross-references have been sup-
plied, marked by the symbol %.

5. In the case of Yid. entry words
which have different meanings in
specific contexts, the context is usually
hinted at by a parenthetical word or
phrase accompanying the Eng. equiva-
lent. Nouns used to narrow down the
context of adjective usage appear after
the adjective; subject nouns narrowing
down the meaning of verbs are placed
before the verb, and object nouns in
similar function are placed after the

6. Here is an example of an entry
containing both types of separation
symbols, with an indication of the
order in which the material must be
read:

מאָרגן צײ ‎tomorrow‏ || איבער מ' ‎day‏

@><—®@ || @——> <-—_®

the day (b)'o } 1% + after tomorrow

@— <—@© +®@——_>

after

c. Subentries

1, Subentries are used for three
purposes: (a) to distinguish gram-
matical categories of the Yid. entry
word; (b) to provide Eng. equivalents
for Yid. phrases containing the entry
word; and (c) to exemplify usage.

2. Subentries reflecting different
grammatical categories are listed sepa-
rately. The symbols indicating the
grammatical categories are explained
in detail in sec. 5, and summarily in
the tables on pp. xl-xliii. Because a
word functioning in multiple gram-
matical categories may require differ-
ent grammatical analysis, the entry
word is sometimes repeated. Ex.:

קאָרן יי סעז || קאָר'ן אי

1015 2638 1024 ‏5זטססס קאָרן‎ 0060 as a
