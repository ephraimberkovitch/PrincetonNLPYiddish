sense (‘make wider’), corresponds to
‏פֿאַרברײ'טער|ן‎ while widen in the in-
transitive sense (‘become wider’) corre-
‏.פֿאַרברײ'שער|ן זיך 10 05מ0ק‎

24 2 dash with a parenthesized 71
signifies that this element is attachable
to the whole group of preceding verbs
under similar conditions. Ex.:

שאָקל|ען, בויטע|ן (--זיך) ‎shake vt/vi‏

This means that shake vt. is rendered
by ‏,בויטען זס שאָקלען‎ whereas shake vi.
is rendered by 71 ]y>pyw or jywna
vr.

Yid. reflexives in 7’? corresponding
to Eng. reflexives in oneself are gen-
erally not listed as separate entries.
Thus, the entry

separate vt. © ‏אָפּ|זוינדער|ן װ‎

automatically implies that 7°r }7yTD1B'y
means ‘‘separate oneself.”’

For further details on transitive con-
structions, see §§ 5c27, 29.

25. Yid. verbs are either perfective
or imperfective. A perfective verb de-
signates completed action. In a large
number of cases the perfective coun-
terpart of an imperfective Yid. verb is
formed by adding a complement or a
prefix. In EY the prefix or comple-
ment of such verbs is listed in paren-
theses opposite the notation “imp/pf.”
Example:

(אויס|)גראָב|ן /2::2/2 אוֹם

This means: the Yid. imperfective
equivalent of dig is jay; the per-
fective equivalent is jay720'1N. Accord-
‏גענראָבן , צ1891‎ UXT Ay jy means ‘while
he 29 6199109/ ; ‏ווען ער האָט אױי'סגענראָבן‎
means ‘when he had dug’.

 

in EY by omitting the repeated stems.
‏אױס|טראַכט|ן, -|קלער|ן ,5טמיך‎ 18 80 400:6-
‏.אויס|טראַכט|ן, אויס|קלער|ן 01 ת13:10ט‎

21. As a rule, complemented verbs
are listed in the Dictionary only if the
proper equivalent could not be inferred
from the entry for the complement
alone. For example, pull in is not
listed as an EY subentry under pull,
since the Yid. equivalent can be de-
termined from ‘‘pull jy|:x’’ and ‘‘in
‏(וטץ ,11806156 ;אַרײַג|צי|ען .6 1 6 אַרײַין‎
down is entered only with the special
submeaning ‘raze’ (as applied, e. g., to
buildings), since the general meaning
of ‘drawing downwards’ can be de-
termined from the separate entries pull
and down.

22. Similar economies prevail in
YE. If a complemented verb is not
found as a separate entry, the entries
for the complement and the stem
should be consulted. The productive
meanings of a complement are listed
under the appropriate entry and illus-
trated immediately. In the case of
multiple meanings, the illustrations are
keyed to the meanings of the com-
plement by means of the letters (a),
(d), etc.

TRANSITIVITY AND PERFECTIVITY

23. In a great many cases a Yid.
verb corresponds to a transitive verb
in Eng., while the same Yid. verb ac-
companied by the pronoun 71 matches
the Eng. verb used intransitively. In
such cases ‏זיך‎ is listed, both in EY and
YE, in parentheses opposite an Eng.
verb marked ‘‘vt/v1.’’ Thus,

widen vt/vt ‏פֿאַרברײ'שער|ן (זיך)‎

means that widen, in the transitive
