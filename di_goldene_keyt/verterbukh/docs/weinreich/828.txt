ized consonant [Ty]. Thus 7 stands
for [ryoKh]. Similarly for the letter
sequences "7, °D, "?, ‏לי‎ and °3, as in:

yoyiy’t = [Dyez’-GEKhrTs]
1y°D8 = [0’-SyEN]
YIN INP = [KA-zyo’-NE]
yy] = [NyA’-NyE]
‏(א8ם-'4ץען == ליאָרעם‎

3. Exceptions from this reading rule
are of two types: (a) where the °
following the ‘‘dental letter,’’ instead
of acting as a sign of palatality of the
preceding consonant, represents a sepa-
rate consonant [y] or a vowel [I];
(b) where palatal consonants are
graphically represented by ‘‘dental
letters’ without following ‏.יי‎ Each ex-
ception is individually marked by the
following devices.

4. The letter > other than as a sign
of palatality

(i) If a» between a “dental letter”
and another vowel represents the
vowel [1], this fact is indicated by
transcription. Thus, [D1] yoy’t means
that the word is pronounced (p1-£’-TE],
not [DyE-TE].

(ii) If a > between a “‘dental letter”
and another vowel represents the con-
sonant [y], this fact is indicated by
transcription. Thus, [zy] o's°13 means
that the word is pronounced [Az-Ya’T],
not [A-zya’T].

(iii) If, after a stressed vowel, a °
between a ‘‘dental letter’ and another
vowel stands for [y] or, in some pro-
nunciations, for [1], this fact is in-
dicated by the symbol ' placed after
the stressed vowel letter. Thus, y't'y
means that the word is pronounced
[a’Z-YE] (or [a’-zI-E]), not [a’-zyE];
similarly, y°3'y7 means that the word

 

stressed word within a longer phrase is
not marked, as.it can usually be in-
ferred from the meaning of the phrase.

4. In hyphenated Yid. words, the
main stress is marked regardless of the
number of syllables, e. g. in yt'™ryaya,
‏.פֿײַ'ער-לעשער‎

5. When a parenthesized portion of
a compound is marked by ', this
means that if the full form is used
(cf. § 3a1), the main stress falls on the
optional element. For example, the
notation 5'yowyi(ab>a) means that
the shorter form is stressed ‏נעשטע'ל‎
‎whereas the longer form is stressed
‏.בי'לדנעשטעל‎

6. Many prefixed and compound
adjectives have been listed with two
5108868 )6. 8. ‏(או'מבאַרע'כטיקט‎ . In some
syntactic positions, notably when they
are used attributively, these adjectives
lose their second stress.

e. Palatal Consonants

1. Corresponding to each of its
dental consonants— [rT D s z N L]—
Yid. has a palatal (“‘soft’’) consonant,
here transcribed, respectively, as [ry py
Sy Zy Ny Ly].* The correct pronuncia-
tion of the palatal [sy] can be ap-
proximated by simultaneously pro-
nouncing [Ss] and [y]; and similarly for
the other palatals.

2. Ordinarily, the letter sequence *»
stands for the consonant [r] followed
by the vowel [i], i.e. for [ri]. If,
however, ’0 is followed by another
vowel letter, it represents the palatal-

* In the author’s College Yiddish the palatal
rendered here as [Ly] is transliterated [LZ].
The need to transliterate the other, much
rarer palatals did not arise in the restricted
vocabulary of an introductory textbook.
