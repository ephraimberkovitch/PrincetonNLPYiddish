‎30. In a few cases of possible am-
biguity the symbol ~~ is used in EY
as an indication that the Yid. word
which precedes it is an adjective.

‎b. Adjectives

‎1. In YE, Yid. adjectives are iden-
tified by the symbol -w after the entry
word.

‎INFLECTIONAL DETAILS

‎2. Adjectives are cited individually
in their stem form. If an adjective is
cited in inflected form (as part of a
Yid. phrase), the inflectional ending is
marked off by a vertical bar:

‏דער קאַ'נטיק|ער קלאַמער ‎square bracket‏

‎This means that if the phrase is used
in a case other than the cited nomina-
tive singular, the inflection must be
adjusted, e.g. in the dative singular:
‏.(דעם) קאַ'נטיקן (קלאַמער)‎

‎3. In compounds which comprise an
inflected adjective, the inflectional
suffix is marked off by a vertical bar.

‎Ex.:
‎friend ‏דער גוט|ער-ברו'דער‎

‎In forms other than the cited nomina-
tive singular, the inflection must be
adjusted, e.g. dative singular (aoy7)
‏.גוטךברו'דער‎

‎4. Most adjectives ending in a con-
sonant plus [L] or [N] require the inser-
tion of ‏{פן‎ before the {L] or [N] if an
inflectional ending is added. This fact
is marked in the Dictionary by a light
dot in the place of the stem where the

‎Nouns DERIVED FROM VERBS

‎28. The Dictionary lists a great
many Yid. nouns derived from verbs,
often corresponding to Eng. nouns in
...ing, ..ation, ...ition, etc. It should
be borne in mind, however, that good
Yid. style often requires a verb in the
infinitive where Eng. uses a noun.
Thus, transportation is matched by the
10. ‏-קאָמוניקאַציע 206 טראַנספּאָ'רט פחטסם‎
These are properly applied to things or
systems. When the reference, how-
ever, is to the act or actwity of trans-
portation, the infinitive verb corre-
sponding to transport is often more
correct. Accordingly, ‘the transporta-
tion of explosives is a delicate task’ is
‏טראַנספּאָרטירן אוי'פֿ- 25 6006160ז 681ט‎ ONT
‏-רײַטװאַרג איז אַ דעליקאַטע אַרבעט‎

‎Noun ApDjuNctTs

‎29. Unlike Eng., Yid. does not use
nouns in adjunct function. Corre-
sponding to Eng. adjunct nouns, one
finds Yid. adjectives, prefixes, or nouns
forming compounds with the modified
noun. Despite certain technical differ-
ences between adjectives and adjunct
nouns in Eng., they have in this Dic-
tionary (in EY) been grouped under
adjectives. Example:

‎middle 1. adj. vobwn ,own

‎This means that the Yid. equivalents
of the Eng. noun adjunct (or adject-
tive) middle are the adjectives shown.
Hence, we have 7" yoyuy for ‘middle
