for a ‘disappearing [E]’’ is marked by
a raised dot. Thus, the transcription

פּסקענ|ען {א"אפאקן
‎means that the conjugated forms are‏

[PASKN] ‏פּסקן‎
‎[PASKNST] ‏פּסקנסט‎
‎[PASKNT] ‏פּסקנט‎
‎[PA’SKENEN] ‏פּסקענען‎

The latter also shows the pronunciation
of the infinitive.

Past-TENSE FORMATION

10. The past participle of each verb
is indicated in the appropriate entry
of YE. It is given in parentheses,
after the symbol». Thus,

װאַרפֿ|ן ײ (נעװאָרפֿן) ‎throw‏

means that the past participle 01 ‏װאַרפֿן‎
‎18 ‏-געװאָרפֿן‎ |

11. If the past tense of a verb is
formed by means of the auxiliary ]21,
this is indicated by the inclusion of ps
before the past participle. All other
verbs form the past tense by means of
the other auxiliary, jayn. Thus the
20126000 ‏קומ|ען י (איז נעקומען)‎ 98
that ‘he came’ is ]yo1py2 px ay . On the
other hand, a notation such as the one
exemplified in §10 above implies that
‏יער האָט געװאָרפֿן 15 שסזם) סם'‎

In the indication of past participles
of reflexive verbs, the element 7 is
201 16064460. 1 ‏דאַכט|ן זיך י (געדאַ'כט) פטם‎
means that the past tense is 71 UNT
‏-געדאַ'כט‎

12. If, as is true of a great many
verbs, the past participle is formed by
the addition of the prefix yi and the

 

GUIDELINES

of an invariant and an inflected aux-
iliary), the infinitive of the auxiliary
is similarly marked. Thus, }|7yn 7'ny)
is inflected a'myi ‏;װערסט געווי'ר , ווער‎
etc.

5. Verbs containing irregularities in
the present-tense inflection are marked
by asterisks. In the case of *}~1 ‘to be’,
the entire inflection is irregular; in
most cases the irregularity involves the
omission of the v- suffix in the third
person singular, or a divergence be-
tween the infinitive and the plural
forms of the present tense. The actual
irregularities are enumerated in the
corresponding entries in YE.

6. Some trisyllabic infinitives con-
tain an [£] in their stems which dis-
appears in the singular and in the
second-person plural of the present
tense. The y representing this “disap-
pearing’ vowel is (in this Dictionary,
but not in the regular orthography) pro-
vided with a diacritic symbol: y. Thus,
iyhy5'y means that the conjugational
forms in question 216 ‏,עפֿנט ,עפֿנסט ,עפֿן‎
200 ‏,עפֿען זסת‎ 640.

7. If the last letter of the stem, as
listed in the infinitive, is ?, this letter
is respelled » in those forms of the
present tense which have no ending or
endings other than jy. Thus, the in-
flected forms of jy|?¥ are spelled >x,
‏.ציט , ציסט‎

8 For verbs whose pronunciation is
given by transcription, only the stem
is transcribed. Thus, [kasher] ]|w>
means that the infinitive is read
[ka’shERN], and the conjugational
‏(כּשרט ,כּשרסט ,, כּשר) פנחזס}‎ 0014, 20-
cordingly, be [xasheR, KAShERST,
KAShERT].

9. For verb stems whose pronuncia-
tion is given by transcription, the place
