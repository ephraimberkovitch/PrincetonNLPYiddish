sitive Eng. verb takes an object in the
dative case, this is symbolized by the
mark+. Ex.:

העלפֿןן יי קוסם

This means: the object of the Yid. verb
is in the dative, e. g. ‘help me’ — »byn
YD.

29. If a Yid. verb requires a prepo-
sitional phrase when used as an equiv-
alent of an Eng. verb (whether the
Eng. verb is transitive, or itself resorts
to a prepositional construction), the
preposition is indicated after the verb.
Thus, “‘treat vt. ‏'באַניי'|ן זיך מיט‎ means
that, corresponding to the Eng. object
phrase, Yid. uses a prepositional phrase
with wp: e. g. ‘how to treat this’ =
‏,ע510112:1 +אַזױ! זיך צו באַנײי'ן מיט דעם‎
come across ps ‏אָנ|שטויס|ן זיך‎
indicates that }s is here the Yid.
equivalent of the Eng. ‘‘across.”” If an
Eng. prepositional phrase corresponds
to a Yid. accusative or dative object,
the fact is usually represented by the
symbols » and 1, respectively. An
example is

steal from = « jy2|yS282

which implies that ‘he stole from her’
15 ‏ער האָט זי באַגנבֿעט‎

On the use of dashes with symbols
applying to whole groups of words, see
§ 3d.

30. Optional constructions with Yid.
verbs are indicated in angular brackets.
Ex.:

interfere (with) () ‏שטערןן‎

This means that the use of a dative

 

26. In addition to prefixes and com-
plements for distinguishing perfective
and imperfective verbs, Yid. also
makes use of other productive patterns
involving auxiliaries. When only an
imperfective equivalent is listed in EY,
this usually means that there is no
complemented or prefixed verb which
functions as the perfective counterpart.
In such cases momentary actions can
be described in Yid. by the ‘‘instan-
taneous” aspect, expressed by the
verbal noun and the auxiliary jyv or
jay). Example:

groan v/imp ‏קרעכצ|ן‎

Single events, e.g. ‘he groaned’, are
described by the instantaneous form:
‏אַ קרעכץ געטאָן/געגעבן‎ ONT Ty. Corre-
spondingly,; a perfective verb can be
given durative meaning by construct-
ing it with the auxiliary ps q|v>yn plus
the infinitive. Example:

excavate v/pf ]|ay73/0"%

They were excavating it’ is rendered
by the durative form, ‏זײ האָבן עס גע"‎
‏.האַלטן אין אױ'סגראָבן‎

GOVERNMENT OF VERBS

27. Asa rule the Yid. equivalent of
a transitive Eng. verb takes the accu-
sative case, and no special indications
of this fact are provided in the Dic-
tionary. Example:

װאַרפֿ|ן י שסזם)

This implies that the object of the
Yid. verb is in the accusative, e. g.
‘throw me’ — 7D AWN.

28. If a Yid. equivalent of a tran-
