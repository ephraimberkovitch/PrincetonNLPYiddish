raphy. Either they are spelled as
single words or they are hyphenated,
according to specific rules.

A Yid. compound noun is written
as a single word unless (a) it is four
or more syllables long; (b) one of its
constituents is a word of Hebrew-
Aramaic origin; (c) one of its constitu-
ents is itself a compound; (d) its first
constituent is a proper name; (e) one
of its constituents is w2. In these cases
the compound is hyphenated. Thus,

נאַ'כטפֿױגל

‘night bird’ is written as a single word;
‏נאַ כט-פֿאַרװײַלונג ,2200 0406 186 םס‎
‘night(time) entertainment’, or

נאַ'כט-פֿלאַטערל

‘moth’ (literally ‘night butterfly’) are
hyphenated because they consist of
four or more syllables each. Likewise,

נאַ'כטישומר

‘night watchman’ is hyphenated be-
cause its second constituent (pro-
nounced [shoyMER]) is of Hebrew-
Aramaic origin. Cf. 4180: ‏;אס הערצל-בוך‎
‏רער ניט-ייד‎ ,*

26. Some 3414. compounds contain
an inflected adjective as a constituent.
See § 5b3.

27. Yid. prefixes are always joined
to the stem in a single word, without
hyphens. In this Dictionary, Yid. pre-
fixes are symbolized by two suspension
points. Ex.:

סוב.., אונטער.. סגופ

* ‏ניטי סמ'ך‎ 1316 applies to adjectives, too.
See entries in YE.

 

CasE INFLECTION OF NouUNS

22. The few nouns which require
the ending [N] as an addition, or as a
replacement of final [£], in the cases
other than nominative are marked by
asterisks. Thus, the asterisk in *yuxv
is a reminder that the dative-accusa-
tive form of this noun 18 ‏טאַטן‎ 200 9
possessive form is ‏.טאַטנס‎

NOMINALIZED ADJECTIVES

23. Nominalized adjectives listed as
Yid. equivalents of Eng. nouns are
given in the masculine nominative
form and are followed by the symbol
22, The inflectional suffix is marked
off by a vertical bar. Ex.:

דער באַאַמט|ער עג .1 ‎official‏

This means that the dative-accusative
form of the masculine word is oy7
]OONRa and that a female official would
be referred to by the feminine form of
the nominalized adjective (nominative

.(די באַאַמטע

‎Nouns‏ פאטספזאסס

‎24. By and large, compound nouns
are listed in the Dictionary only if the
equivalence between the Yid. and the
Eng. terms is not predictable from
the equivalents of the components.
Other compounds can usually be
formed at will. For example, if you
do not find night bird as an entry, you
can form the corresponding Yid. com-
pound by looking up night (uD~3) and
‏.דער נאַ' כטפֿױגל ,.12ט ; (די פֿױגל) 4זוט‎

‎25. In contrast to Eng., Yid. noun
compounds are never written as sepa-
rate words in the standardized orthog-
