DICTIONARY

1. Arrangement of English-Yiddish Part (EY)

flake ‏שניי'עלע (ך) (שסמפ) || ײ שופּ (|ן)‎ on
003 49 || 3 ‏דידי‎

|| (soap) (7) yoyb!r on

4. If there is not enough room in a
line for the completion of a Yid. word
or word-sequence, the Yid. material is
continued on the left of the next line.
Ex.:

דס אַָ'נבײַסן (ס), הס ‎dinner (main meal)‏

0 ~®

SZ
“FN

װאַרמעס (|)

—®@

5. If the Yid. word or word-sequence
thus completed is followed by another
Eng. subentry, the Yid. material is
separated from the new subentry by
the symbol 4. This symbol therefore
means that whatever appears to the
left of it should be read first, as it
forms the completion of the preceding
line. Ex.:

 

xii

a. Order of Material

1. Each entry begins with an Eng.
entry word in bold-face type. If the
entry runs over beyond the first line,
the lines other than the first are in-
dented on the left. Many entries
contain a main entry and one or more
subentries. The subentries do not
themselves form beginnings of new
paragraphs.

2. Each entry word is matched by
a Yid. equivalent, which is read from
right to left. Where an entry word is
matched by a sequence of several Yid.
words, the Yid. sequence is read in the
Yid. order, from right to left. Ex.:

ell (7) ‏ד אייל‎
OQ<—_®

דער אָװאַ'ל (|), חי עלי'פּס (|) ‎ellipse‏
‏)@— 6

SZ
7 5

3. A subentry is ordinarily sepa-
rated from the preceding material by
the symbol ||. The following example
illustrates the order in which the
material should be read:
