8. Occasionally a submeaning of a
Yid. word, when used in a special con-
struction, is more conveniently ex-
plained by an example in context than
by an abstract equivalence. The user
of the Dictionary may from such an
example infer the correct form of the
Yid. phrase in other tenses, persons,
etc., and the corresponding Eng. trans-
lations. For example, under 4y|p\p we
find the illustrative phrase 7 ‏איך קום‎
‏דאַנק‎ & glossed as ‘... I am grateful to
you’. From this it follows that ‘they
were grateful to us’ corresponds to
‏זיי האָבן אונדז געקו'מט אַ דאַנק‎ 820 simi-
larly for other tenses, persons, etc.

 

verb. For example, under the verb }™),
‘(machine) function” means that if the
subject of the verb is the name of a
machine, j”1 is best translated as
“function.”

6. Yid. homonyms appear as sepa-
rate entries; if their grammatical cate-
gories overlap, they are distinguished
by superscript numbers. See for ex-
ample the two entries headed by
‏.באַשװער||? 226 באַשװער ||ז‎

7. Yid. phrases exemplifying usage
are occasionally given if the corre-
sponding Eng. construction differs
sharply from the Yid. See, for in-
stance, the exemplification of the
phrase § YD JN under 7K.

3. Condensed Entries

prefixes and complements, see §§ 5c23,
25.

3. It is to be understood that if an
optional element is omitted, the last
letter of the remaining element must,
in writing, be changed to its word-final
form (if any). Thus, (wsy)o1"8 means
6146 ‏-אַרו'ם ?0 אַרומערט‎

b. Diagonal

1. Alternative words are separated
by a diagonal. For example:

he’s got to obey y2>xB ‏ער מוז/דאַרף‎

This formula means that either no “Ay
‏דאַרף פֿאָלגן זס פֿאָלנן‎ ay may be used as
Yid. equivalents of the Eng. phrase.
Similarly:

in/for fun oyngoyp ‏אויף‎

 

a. Parentheses

1. Optional parts of a word or
phrase are placed in parentheses. Ex.:

maid (servant) (7»9)voIr1 4

From the above formula it is to be
understood that maid has two equiva-
1648: 611061 ‏דינסטמויד 01 די דינסט‎ 4.

2. When an optional element of an
Eng. expression has a corresponding
option in Yid., both are placed in
parentheses. Ex.:

behave (well) (j>w) pr q|V5[5K"

This means that 7 ‏אױפֿ|פֿיר|ן‎ is
“behave” 28 ‏אױפֿ|פֿיר|ן זיך שיין‎ 15 ''26-
have well.”
