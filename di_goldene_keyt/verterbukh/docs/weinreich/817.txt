sulting the entry for the complement
alone in YE. Thus, the fact that the
complement }'2" is stressed on the
last syllable, both in the infinitive
(]|ag70|3'2 7) and in the several present-
tense forms ‏אַרײַ'|)‎ NW, etc.), can be
determined by consulting YE under
‏-אַרײַין‎

17. If a complement is optional
with a particular verb, it is listed in
parentheses. Thus,

(אַרױס|)קוק|ן 0840 סטוֹע

means that ‘‘give onto” is equivalent
40 6116 ‏אַרױ'סקוקן זס קוקן‎ (Parentheses
are used in similar ways to indicate
optional prefixes, as in ‏,(פֿאַר)האָפֿ|ן סקס‎
86 ‏(.פּאַס|ן (זיך) 84 תז 45 ,זיך 110021ק0‎
Concerning the perfectivizing function
of complements, see § 5c25.

18. If a complemented verb forms
its past participle by the devices de-
scribed in §§ 5c12 and 5c13, the same
symbols are used. Ex.:

אָפּ|מאַכ|ן י 6
אָפּ| פּאָליר || יי 00

This means that the past participle of
‏-2111כן 286 406 820 אָ'פּגעמאַכט 15 אָ'פּמאַכן‎
0116 01 ‏-אָ פּפּאָלירט 15 א פּפּאָלירן‎

19. If a series of Yid. verbs listed
as equivalents of an Eng. word differ
only in their complements, the series
is abbreviated in EY by avoiding the
repetition of the stems. Thus,

אָפּן-, אויס|מעק|ן

15 ‏אָפּ|מעק|ן, אויס|מעק|ן 10 +132162ט60‎
20. If a series of Yid. verbs listed
as equivalents of an Eng. word are
identical as to complements but differ
in their stems, the series is abbreviated

sufhx vw to the stem, this fact is in-
dicated by the conventional symbol ©.
Thus, © » }|>49 means that the past
‏-געמאַ'כט 15 מאַכן 01 211101016סן‎

13. If the past participle is formed
by the addition of the suffix » only,
this fact is indicated by the conven-
tional symbol ©. Thus, 0( ‏פֿאַרמאַכ|ן ו‎
means that the past participle of
‏.פֿאַרמאַ'כט 19 פֿאַרמאַכן‎

COMPLEMENTATION

14. Adverbial complements, which
in the infinitive are prefixed to the
stem, are in this Dictionary marked off
from the stem by a vertical bar,
e.g. j[ayajonr. In the present-tense
conjugation these complements are
separated and placed after the stem as
separate words, e. g. DIN ANT, YOIND
DIN, DIN JAN, etc.

Irregularities of the conjugation of
an asterisked complemented verb are
enumerated in Y E under the entry for
the verb stem alone. E.g. the in-
flectional details of ‏עגנת אוס|נעב|ן‎ 6
found in YE under *j|Ay1.

15. The complement, when prefixed
to the verb stem, automatically re-
ceives an overriding stress, which
therefore is not marked in the Dic-
tionary. Thus, the stress ‏אױס|נראָב|ן ת!‎
is [o’ysGROBN]. The symbol |, if it
occurs within the stem, refers to a
stress that becomes manifest on a syl-
lable of the verb (other than the next
to last) when the complement is sepa-
rated; e. g. the 1st person plural of the
‏פֿאַירטיקן 15 אויס|פֿאַ'רטיק|ן 29 119460 סזסט‎
DMN.

16. The place of the stress within
the complement is not marked. In case
of doubt it can be determined by con-
