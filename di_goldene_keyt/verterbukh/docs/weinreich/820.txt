are treated as separate entries. In
parentheses after such entry words in
YE, the base form of the adjective is
identified, followed by the symbol a.
Ex.:

comprehensive (A uxyd) ~~ ‏לענגער‎

This entry means that syuy> is the
comparative of uyd. In addition to the
listed meaning ‘comprehensive’, it can
be inferred to have the meaning
longer’ as well.

ATTRIBUTIVE ADJECTIVES AND
PREDICATE ADJECTIVES

9. Yid. adjectives which are re-
stricted to attributive or nominalized
function are marked by a following
asterisk, especially if the corresponding
Eng. adjective is not governed by a
similar restriction. Thus, in the entry
minute we find the Yid. equivalent
«pss. The asterisk indicates that one
can ‏דאָס פּי'צינקע שטײַ'בעלע ,.6.8 ,/ג9‎
‘the minute speck’, but not ‏דאָס‎
‏.שטײַ'בעלע איז פּיצינק‎

10. Adjectives of the opposite cate-
gory — those which are restricted to
predicate function, and which are thus
uninflected, are identified by the sym-
bol ». Thus, worthy [RoE] » “85
means that one can say ‏דער מענטש איז‎
nga ‘this man is worthy’, but not
‏.דער ראָױ מענטש‎

11. In the case of adjectives based
on the past participle of }|xv (i.e.
‏צו'געטאָן ,אָ'פּגעטאָן‎ , 640.(, 486 11
inflected forms ‏-8ס 26 (אָ'פּנעטאָנענער)‎
emplified by the masculine listed in
parentheses after the entry word in

YE.

 

insertion takes place. Thus, ]'58 means
that the inflected forms of this adjec-
tive 216 ‏אָיפֿענע ,אָ'פֿענעם אַ'פֿענער‎ 4
‏אָפֿנער זסת‎ etc. Note that the dot mark-
ing the required insertion is a teaching
aid introduced in this Dictionary and
1s not used in the normal orthography.

5. In adjectives of this type whose
pronunciation is given in transcription,
the dot is placed in the transcription;
thus [shor] 55w means that an in-
flected form such as  y>5w is pro-
nounced [sho’FreLER].

6. A few adjectives whose stems end
in [ELN] lose the [ge] if inflectional
sufhxes are added. In such cases the
‘disappearing {E]’’ is here marked as y.
This means that the inflected forms
of yoyniya are ‏באַ'װלנער‎ 6005 16
syiysyn'ga). Note that the diacritic
symbol is a teaching aid introduced in
this Dictionary and 1s not used in the
normal orthography.

COMPARISON

7. For adjectives which undergo
stem changes under comparison, the
comparative is listed in parentheses,
after the symbol A, in YE. Thus,

‎A) vdyp‏ קעלטער)

‎means that the comparative 01 ‏קאַלט‎
‎is ayubyp; the superlative, accord-
ingly, is wowbyp. In the few cases
where the superlative displays further
irregularities, it is separately listed (in
YE only) after the symbol AA.

‎8 A few Yid. adjectives in the
comparative have meanings which are
not adequately rendered by the corre-
sponding comparative in Eng. These
