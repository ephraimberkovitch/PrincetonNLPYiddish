There are no more lamentations
Nor songs of woe
In the ancient texts.

God of Mercy

Sanctify another land,

Another Sinai.

We have covered every field and stone

With ashes and holiness.

With our crones

With our young

With our infants

We have paid for each letter in your Commandments.

God of Mercy

Lift up your fiery brow,

Look on the peoples of the world,

Let them have the prophecies and Holy Days
Who mumble your words in every tongue.
Teach them the Deeds

And the ways of temptation.

God of Mercy

To us give rough clothing

Of shepherds who tend sheep

Of blacksmiths at the hammer

Of washerwomen, cattle slaughterers
And lower still.

And O God of Mercy

Grant us one more blessingâ€”

Take back the divine glory of our genius.

1945 Irving Howe
