The Clever River

It was a river said one day,

“Flow all rivers to the sea?

Is earth so small, and are

The lands that rain forgot so rare?

Lands that lie and languish

Parched for water? Places that still anguish

For a drop of rain? Tell me, wouldn’t it be better

To flow to them instead of to the sea to make it wetter?
In all this haste and hurry there’s no time for thinking,
No still reflective moment as the sun is sinking.

No. I'll not with the others. I’ll take a brand-new path.
And be assured—you have my solemn oath—

That even if His Highness Sea should send

To say, ‘Take any of my pearls,

Or choose whichever of my siren-girls

You please,’

I'll turn my back on him. I will refuse.”

Off went the stream; began strange ways to wander
Through woods and over fields on its meander
Through bone-dry desert places.

Everywhere he traced his

Way the merest pebble eagerly

Received him (no fool he).

The stream snaked on; it twisted on

And on

Through pathways new until it came

To the sultry desert, hot as flame—

How does the story end?

Go ask the scorching sand.

Yes, it’s fine to make new paths; it’s good to search.
But don’t creep into deserts. Deserts scorch.
