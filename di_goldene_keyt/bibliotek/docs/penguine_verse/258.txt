a belt,
a bit of broken cup,
a leaf of Scripture.

Even now

on the rivers of Siberia

you can find

some trace:

a scrap of the raft

the river swallowed;

in the woods

a bloodied swatch dried stiff;
some frozen footprints

over the snow.

Cynthia Ozick

With the holy poem

With the holy poem

clenched between my teeth,

I set forth alone

from that wolf-cave, my home,
to roam

street after street

like a wolf

with his solitary bone.

There is prey enough in the street
to sate wolf-hate, wolf-lust.
Sweet is the blood

that steams and drips

from flesh,

but sweeter the dry dust

that has settled on clamped lips.

Struggle in the streets.

From hoarse throatsâ€”the call.
Let me for once become

all deadly tooth and claw,
