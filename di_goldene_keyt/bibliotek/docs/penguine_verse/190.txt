blue-eyed, with the gold of grainfields

in his curly head, “The man of poetry.”

And Avrom-Moyshe should be remembered too;
he accompanied the orchestra

on his single string in his own way.

All of them lie in the great field of peace,

and all generations are equal,

shaded by trees, covered with grass,

a half hour’s walk from the hill where I sit.
