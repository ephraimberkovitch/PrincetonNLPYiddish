Moyshe Kulbak

And avidly mingle

Flame-black moustaches, glistening small teeth,

Tinkling curls,
Cravats,
Hand-carved shoes,
Lightning glances
And hose...

Dizzied with drink,

In the silence of a pulsating heart,
Knees nestle closer and

Closer, scattering sparks.

Fire glows from the pupil

OF each eye;

And eyelashes tremble, tremble.

A cello suddenly groans

In the orchestra,

Like the grief heard in a wood
Of abandoned nests;

A blood-red half moon pierces the window;
And a hand appears;

A work-gnarled,

Chain-shackled hand

That sets letters of blood

On the wall: DE ATH.

And gentlemen in stiff coats
Dance with white-silken ladies
Bright,

Brighter,

And brighter . .

The brass platters yell;

The clarinets laugh,

The cymbals chatter.

Drums muffle the deep grieving of fiddles.

The basses, like old grave-makers, dig their dark shovels.

Leonard Wolf
