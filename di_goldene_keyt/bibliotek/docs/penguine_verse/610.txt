But the cry at the window is tremulous, fine
As a spider’s web or a violin

Or the gasp of a dying child, turned thin
While the child’s head writhes against the wind.

The Baal Shem opens the door and tries

To discover what creature disturbs the joys—
The joys and dreams of all the world.

The river dozes and there the town

Is dozing and the field as well.

Who’s weeping now

When the bird, the wind, and the hut all sleep
And the forest sleeps along with them?

Who drives the gold away from his dream?
“Listen,” the Baal Shem says, and turns
To the exiled grief, “Come sleep in my hands.”

But the cry at the window is tremulous, fine
As a spider’s web or a violin

Or the gasp of a dying child, turned thin
While the child’s head writhes against the wind.

Then he raises his clear eyes . .

To heaven raises his clear eyes

And sees a gray cloud squeeze against
A single star, and then

The Baal Shem stands a moment by
Attentive to its silver cry.

He raises to heaven his brilliant hand. . .
To heaven raises his brilliant hand

And eases the cloud away. The star

Begins to flutter. Relieved of fear,

It flutters and shimmers, sparks and rings
Through the air, like fine gold rings.

The Baal Shem smiles and says, ‘You bum,
You've shaken the world into alarm.”
