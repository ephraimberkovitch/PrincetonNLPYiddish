 

Joseph Rolnik

But that sensitive young kid
couldn’t stomach stale pork—
he gagged and felt sick.

And all our young generation,

we were loud with foul talk

behind girls’ backs and women’s dresses.

We troubled the sleep of the pious,

knocking store signs over,

and did lots of things we didn’t like,

all because we wanted to rouse God’s wrath—
being pricked on by our sixteen years

the way ripe oats will prick a horse.

And God who watched over us all,

God against whom we talked with such impudence,
sat there on his throne in heaven

and laughed into his deep white beard.
