434 Jacob Glatstein

This poem was written in response to the destruction of European Jewry.
In challenging God it inverts many familiar passages and beliefs. The
morning prayers open with the invocation, “How goodly are your tents,
O Jacob, your habitations, O Israel!” (Numbers 24:5). According to the
Kabbalistic doctrine of Shevirat ha-kelim, the divine light which flowed
into primordial space should have been caught and held in special
“bowls,” or vessels, that emanated from God for this purpose. But the
light broke forth too suddenly, and under its impact the vessels were
broken and their fragments scattered into the depths of evil.

Without Jews

Without Jews, no Jewish God.
If, God forbid, we should quit
this world, Your poor tent’s light
would out.

Abraham knew You in a cloud:
since then, You are the flame
of our face, the rays

our eyes blaze,

our likeness

whom we formed:

in every land and town

a stranger.

Shattered Jewish skulls,

shards of the divine,

smashed, shamed pots—

these were Your light-bearing vessels,
Your tangibles,

Your portents of miracle!

Now count these heads

by the millions of the dead.
Around You the stars go dark.
Our memory of You, obscured.
Soon Your reign will close.
Where Jews sowed,

a scorched waste.
