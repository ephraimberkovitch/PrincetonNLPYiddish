YANKEV FRIDMAN
1910, Milnitse, then Galiciaâ€”1972, Ramat Aviv.

T isisea in the cosmopolitan city of Chernovtsy (Czernowitz),
then part of Rumania. He survived the ghetto of Bershad, in the
Ukraine. After the war, attempting to reach Palestine, he was in-
terned for two years in Cyprus. Once in Israel, he farmed in vil-
lages until 1960, then lived in Ramat Aviv. Fridman was the author
of long dramatic poems as well as lyrics, and his oral style seems to
derive from the Hasidic narrative tradition, though he speaks of
God in a wry and modern idiom. Among his postwar poems are
many on the Hasidic personalities and remembered experiences of
his youth.
