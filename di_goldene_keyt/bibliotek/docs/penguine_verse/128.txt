This poem and the following one, “Neighbors,” are both parts of a longer
work in fourteen sections called ‘‘Poets.”

Poets

We have such plain faces

and talk quite ordinary talk;

the glow from our eyes is sober,
our joy altogether commonplace.

When we go in to eat, we sit down
in work clothes at the table set for us,
and when we bury someone close

it’s on a day like any other.

Half asleep in the cold dawns, we hurry

to get under the whip on time,

and we drive away the young little poems

like the house dog who tries to come running along.
