 

Jacob Glatstein

You'll begin with a scrap of truth,

not promising seventh heaven,

mindful of human flesh, bone, failings;
wine that gladdens the heart of man;

the body’s pleasures.

You'll cherish us for those moments of belief
when out of our depths we invoke You.
You'll keep far from blood, blade, killing.
You'll choose to be the approachable God
of a prayerful huddle

rather than an omnipotent God of Prey.
You'll come near.

We'll begin to spin

merciful laws binding on You and on us.

Out of the cradle and little,

why don’t we start all over again,

growing up bordered by a hallowed land?
Children will laugh all around in delight.
We'll be poor and full of truth.

Your holy blessing will just suffice

for a people peaceable and good.

My own word will be the warm pride

of a family.

Your nostrils will savor

the pure meal-offering of a nation
nurturing its God with everything good.
And me they’ll feed and fondle like a child.
1'11 06 rocked in cozy fame.

No one beyond our borders will hear my name,
or Yours.

Shouldn’t the two of us go home?
Why don’t we both, beaten, go home?

Thou hast chosen us.

We were both cried up for grandeur
so that they could bring us to dust
and scatter us and stamp us out.
