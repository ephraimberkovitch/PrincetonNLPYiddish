and pain,

to see Yiddishkayt becoming
no deeper than the tune

the cantor’s humming,

while by and by

the well of ritual runs dry.

 

A Yiddishkayt of folk air

to prick the heart and pour
warm honey at the sight

of things that touch the cockles?
If that’s the stuff we celebrate,
we'd better do without.

Yiddish poets, are you bees

who close the feast

with honey-store

of song, and nothing more?

You are the choirboy in the ruined chorus
who completes the last Amen.

No more remembrance for us;

‘we counted on it all the while

till drop by drop

we used it up.

Nostalgic now for rhyme, for melody,
for a zest gone stale,

around our heads we whirl

the sacrificial bird,

muttering

our empty word.

Longing’s a crooning

for old men gumming sops.
Was it we were doomed to dole
these bits of soggy bread—

the sacrificial bird, kapore (Heb. Kapara): the custom of post-Talmudic origin,
objected to by some religious authorities, of transferring the sins of a man or
woman to a sacrificial cock or hen on the eve of the Day of Atonement.
