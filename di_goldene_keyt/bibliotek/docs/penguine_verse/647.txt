LEYZER VOLE
(Mekler) 1910, Vilnaâ€”1943, outside Samarkand.

ing, antiromantic vein (under a pen name) that reflects the
darker side of his nature. His poetry often tends to black humor
and the grotesque; without leaving Vilna, he parodied his own
images of cosmopolitan Europe. Volf was one of the most prolific
members of the literary-artistic group Yung Vilne. He escaped to
the Soviet Union after the German invasion of Poland and died
there of starvation. Only a small fraction of his writing remains.
