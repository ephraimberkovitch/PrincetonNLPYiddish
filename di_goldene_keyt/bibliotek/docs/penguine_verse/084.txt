to the most profound,

and can sound the Taz

and the ocean of Shas;
however stony the Rambam,
he finds a cleft in the rock.

And he’s beautiful.
Black as night, his locks:
his lips are roses;

black arching eyebrows
and sky-blue eyes,
fire-bright.

A joy to see.
Ah, the blushes and sighs
when the maidens see Monish

go by.

The young rebetsin at kheyder
watches Monish, nothing else,
and she melts;

and the pots in the oven

spill and burn

as she sits,

her hands in her lap,

seeming to hear

how the children learn.

And the neighbor, pretty Odl,
lets her needle fall
as she listens to Monish:

Taz, Shas, Rambam: works of commentary on the Law. Taz (tur zahav) is a classic
commentary on the Shulkhan Arukh, the Code of Jewish Law; Shas (shisha
sedorim) refers to the six-sectioned Mishna, one of the two main parts of the
Talmud; Rambam refers to the Mishneh Torah of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon,
Maimonides (1135—1204).

rebetsin: in this context, a teacher's wife.

kheyder: Jewish elementary school for boys.
