Until the virgin silhouette
Fades in the pallid glow.

Leonard Wolf

The Crucified and the Verminous Man

On the darkening road, stands the verminous man
Who rouses from sleep the crucified one.

“Tell me, O Jesus, where did you hear
That your crown is holier than my tear?

Jesus, tell me, who says that your crown
Is holier than all my pain?”

King Jesus stammers, “I’m only a child
Whose home is the wind where I’m crucified.”

King Jesus stammers, ‘‘Woe and thrice woe
To my scarlet spring amid fallen snow.”

Feverish, the verminous man says, ““My home
Is cobwebs and night and wind and loam.

Forever a stranger, wherever I go,
Lice flicker like stars in my shirt—they glow.

You are rocked on the wind by two women so mild.
One murmers, ‘Beloved,’ the other says ‘Child.’

There are pitying lips for each of your wounds;
They hallow your flesh, O crucified man.

There are bended knees for each of your thorns;
They hallow your cross, O crucified man.

While I am like shadows, or dogs that bark
Or howl, abandoned on roads after dark.”
