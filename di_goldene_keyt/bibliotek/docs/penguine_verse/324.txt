Small is what we are, so small—
Fear drags us to the earth,
As if we were fear’s very own.

Where, then, we small ones,

Can we hide?

Where can we hide our full-grown grief?
Our grief?

Our love?

Our secrets?

Day and night—
We must loom large within their eyes,
They bother with us so.

Allen Mandelbaum and Harold Rabinowitz

Esau

Esau,

Hairy Esau, blessed with fragrant fields;
To you I owe an ancient debt,

Debt deep within my marrow,

Buried in my innards’ shadows. .

Esau,

Quietly, behind your back,

Quietly I sensed the savor of your good fortune,
Esau—that sturdy draft

of your fragrant fields... .

Esau,

Hairy Esau, with our blind father’s blessing

On your wild, wooded head,

On your genile, fair hair—

Don’t ask for payment now, Esau... not now.
Drop by drop you have seeped your way
