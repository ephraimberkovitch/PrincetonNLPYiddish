Ukraine province—1953, New York.

and worked in shoe factories until forced by tuberculosis to
find less demanding employment. As the leading figure of Di
Yunge he placed individual mood and sensation at the heart of
poetry and believed, with the Russian Symbolists, that the poet
transforms the commonplace through acts of artistic alchemy. To
achieve melodious verse, an ideal of softness in sound, Mani Leyb
initially stripped Yiddish vocabulary of its Slavic and Hebrew
components, especially the guttural consonants, creating effects of
assonance and hushed alliteration. The appeal of simplicity as an
aesthetic goal attracted him to folk songs and folk motifs, and to
the writing of children’s verse.

Beginning in the 1920s his poetry gained in density and emo-
tional depth. He translated widely from Russian and Ukrainian as
part of an arrangement with the Jewish Daily Forward (Forverts)
that called for weekly poems, either originals or translations. Con-
scious of the missing ‘classical’ tradition of Yiddish poetry, he
provided something of the kind in his later sonnets. They bring a
sense of resolution to very complex themes in verse of formal
regularity.
