The sun is good to all. It shines even to cut

Across to dead graves through the cemetery fence,
Shining for the grass and for the blindworms thence,
To raise them up from death, from its distended gut.

It must have God’s consoling sign of old to give:
That from death, even, there springs forth life that will live.

John Hollander

Hersh Itsi was the name.of the poet's father. Jews were traditionally
buried in white shrouds, and shards were placed over their eyes as a sym-
bol of their return to earth.

Inscribed on a Tombstone

Here lies Hersh Itsi’s son: on his unseeing
Eyes are shards; in his shroud, like a good Jew.
He walked into this world of ours as to

A yearly fair, from that far town Nonbeing

To peddle wind. On a scale he weighed out

All that he owned to a wheeler-dealer friend,
Got back home to light candles, tired at the end
When the first Sabbath stars had just about

Curtained his town’s sky above all the Jews.

Now here he lies. His grave stands, mossed in green,
Between him and the gray week, as between
Sabbath delights and the fair’s noisy stews.

Great blasts of wind that could outlast him still
Were left to all the children in his will.

John Hollander
