In the Tavern

A band of carousers sits crammed in a tavern;

With dark hair disheveled, they lean and they sprawl

On the benches.

They sit and they drink in the tavern. A band of carousers.

One rolls up his sleeve; he strikes with his hand at his bosom:
“There’s a worm in there, gnawing,” he says.

Someone else starts to speak as he lifts his earthenware beaker,
“T have slept in the fields of Russia,

And spent days on its loneliest roads;

Now tell me, where shall I bury this body,

This wasted life that drags me along, still complaining?”
Someone else, a tall, affable stranger,

Smiles and says,

“There’s nothing I’ve lost, my friend,

For there’s nothing I’ve owned.”

Alone in a corner, a traveler sits.

Trembling a bit, he mutters,

“Ah, tell me if anyone can,

Who it was who forgot me here

In a tavern where my doom is to sit

At an empty table

For reasons unknown?

It may be that my guardian is wandering about;

It may be I’m a shadow mislaid by its owner—L’chaim.””

A band of carousers drinks what is left of the time. .
L’chaim.

Drunkards, exiled and spurned by men and by God...
L’chaim.

A young woman with pale, gleaming eyes goes to the window.
The drinkers turn their faces and send their dull gazes

L'chaim: “to life,” the traditional Jewish toast.
