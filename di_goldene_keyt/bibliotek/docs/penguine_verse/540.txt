512 Shmuel Halkin

Of Things Past

My father’s lips that might be blessing someone,

His eyes turned toward the hardening, green west;
The corpse-cold curtain pulled back from the window
To let his fingers brush away the frost... .

In the sky the first two stars like pinpricks;

A silver gleam from the frog-rumpled marsh:

O leave the weekday cloth still off the table

Let that much of the Sabbath not depart... .

1920 Hillel Halkin

This tribute to Russia gains resonance from the concluding reference to a
well-known image in the Talmud: Moses is said to have died when God
took his soul through a kiss. For a further discussion of this poem—
important in the history of Yiddish poetry written in the Soviet Union—
see the Introduction, page 18.

Russia

Russia! If my faith in you were any less great

I might have said something different.

I might have complained: You have led us astray,
And seduced us young wandering gypsies.

Precious to us is each blow of your hand,
Though frightfully painful to bear.

Yet no matter how great the hurt or the shame,
We have come to you to declare:

To where could the oceans implore us
To go now, to what distant shores,

the first two stars: The Sabbath comes to an end when three stars are visible.
