I kneel to the fragrance
of the last apple,
and I pick it up.

In my hands—the tree,

in my hands—the leaf,

in my hands—the blossom,
and in my hands—the earth
that kisses the apple

that no one picks up.

Widowhood
1

Do something
to the W

in “widow”
so it won't be
like a spider

that crawls on my flesh
scratching death,
scratching

death.

Do something
to the
WwW.
