138 Mani Leyb

This is the smell of cake and brandy passed at a circumcision
After prayers, by free-handed celebrants, to all
From where the poor sit to the high-toned eastern wall.

John Hollander

To the Gentile Poet

Heir of Shakespeare, shepherds and cavaliers,
Bard of the gentiles, lucky you are indeed!
The earth is yours: it gives your fat hog feed
Where e’er it walks, your Muse grazes on hers.

You've sat, a throstle in your tree, and trilled
Still answered by all the far-flung elsewheres,
By fullness of fields, by wide city squares,
By sated hearts’ serenity fulfilled.

But I, a poet of the Jews—who needs it!l—

A folk of wild grass grown on foreign earth,
Dust-bearded nomads, grandfathers of dearth—
The dust of fairs and texts is all that feeds it;

 

I chant, amid the alien corn, the tears
Of desert wanderers under alien stars.

John Hollander
