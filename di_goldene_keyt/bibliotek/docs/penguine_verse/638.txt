610 Berish Weinstein

In the Port

Steel anchors with thick ropes lie on stone floors,

Crates, tall stacks of bales, sacks tightly packed;

A scattering of trunks with expensive brass locks;

Barrels of kerosene; reinforced concrete in ironbound barrels;
From the walls, there rise the cool smells of exotic trade goods.

Broad ships arrive from Cherbourg, from Le Havre.

The French sailors are young and quick; they have nimble feet

To clamber up ropes, and their faces are swarthy.

Much travel has taught them to read clouds, winds, and
rainstorms,

And they know how to signal at night among winds on the ocean.

Loading the goods are Poles, Negroes, powerful Jews and Italians;

They carry hooks on their shoulders and, round their waists,
packets of food bound in pouches.

They wear aprons of leather, and coarse, stiff shirts made of linen.

The strongest have taut-muscled stomachs, quick hands with
broad fingers

That are yellow and coarse, torn at by ropes, and by crates they've
tipped open,

And peeling in layers like the hooves of horses.

In the port, the foreign ships anchor, fending off water and wind;

Foreign faces debark; Germans and Jews with terrified children,

Their clothes ticketed with namesâ€”of a street or a kinsman;

And the faces are mute, behind heavy cold bars; behind fences.

Bars of disciplined fear of uniforms; of a calendar stern with
what's destined.

Steel anchors with thick ropes lie on stone floors;

Familiar baskets dotted with stamps and seals of crossed borders.

In the port the pavement gleams, windswept by carts of luggage
and footsteps;

Clouds over the port darken the depot; windowpanes grow heavy
with evening.

From the walls there rise the cool smells of exotic trade goods.
