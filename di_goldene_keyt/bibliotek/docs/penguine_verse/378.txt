350 Perets Markish

They were muddied,
Nailed down—

Hey, human mothers! Thou shalt not roast them...
Thou shalt not fry them.

1920 Leonard Wolf

Out of frayed sackcloth—breasts of filthy cataracts,
Like raw potatoes, branched with rooted blue veins.
What shall we trade? Salt? How much do you want?
There’s a dead child’s hat still here.

In the marketplace, a surveyor dozes like a white skull—

A homeless dog sniffs him as he would an old cadaver.

What shall we trade? Bread? How much do you bid?

A pack of dogs in the street ‘tears a heap of rusted brains into
bits.

And birds in the air flap like scattered black -hats—

A disheveled tuft of wind keeps trying them on—

Is there a deal? Wind! What do you bid for a windmill?

There, across foothills, they aimlessly quarrel over eagles’
wings.

Making a trade? Wind? What do you bid?

1920 Leonard Wolf

Cattle carry on their horns

The cries of the flocks.

Ah, in our great nation of grief
Sorrow grows on trees.

T’ll not whet my ax on them,

Nor fence myself round with them.
