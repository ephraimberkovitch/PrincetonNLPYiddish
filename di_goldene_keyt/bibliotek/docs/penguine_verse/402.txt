Too silent shepherds; too gusting fires.
1, too, would come near to smoke a cheerless cigar,
But the day flickers, and cities, churches, are burning.

Ah, soldiers’ songs from the Russian frontiers—
When day expires upon your drawn-out breaths

I gather, like bits of bread, the distant sounds that cross the
border.

Leonard Wolf

This is part of a long poem entitled To a Jewish Dancer written after the
German invasion of Poland, 1940. It could not be published at the time
because of the German-Soviet pact. Part of it appeared in 1945 in Russian
translation. The entire poem appeared in Yiddish only posthumously, in
1959.

From To a Jewish Dancer

My homeless one, will you ever fly again?

Is there a road on which your grief’s unknown?
Lithuanian Brisk is opened like an old book,
And multitudes come bearing grief and woe.

Hunched, on foot, with children in their arms,

And exile knotted with waistbands to their loins,
Their beards point high, in the direction of the stars.
Parchment foreheads over theories quarrel.

Their mouths are warmed by flickering candle stubs,
Set out, as for a shive on the earth.

Winds wail: they wonder who will pity them.
Frequently a star runs past and glitters like a sword.

Brisk: Jewish name for the city of Brest-Litovsk.
shive: the period of mourning for the dead.
