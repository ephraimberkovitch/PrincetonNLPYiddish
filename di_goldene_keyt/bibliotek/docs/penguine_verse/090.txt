and to pass the time away,
far away from Gehenna,
and isn’t it a pretty téte-d-téte?

One morning

as Sammael lay in bed smoking cigarettes,

and Lilith saw to her toilette

by the light of the tsoyer

(the gem that lights the ark),

the doorbell tinkled in the foyer:

“Enter!”

and there a trembly demon stood,

teeth all a-clatter,

who flung himself flat on his face and then flatter.

“My lord and sire,

You’ve hidden your face

from your people.

You've heard

and seen nothing,

and now it’s too late!

Your throne is going to topple!”

Satan leaped up. ‘Sir Baron,
what transpires?’’

“In the kingdom of Poland
where the border is drawn
stands a shte#l

as big as a yawn.

The place doesn’t matter,
it’s rarely mentioned,
houses like nutshells,
prayers are their mansions!

Gehenna: hell.

tsoyer: legendary gem or window that served as a source of light in Noah’s
ark.

shtetl: small east European market town inhabited largely by Jews.
