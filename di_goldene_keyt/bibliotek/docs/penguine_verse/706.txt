678 Abraham Sutzkever

The Rom Press since the end of the eighteenth century was a prestigious
traditional press and publishing house in Vilna, later run by the Widow
Rom and Sons. It was renowned for its editions of the Talmud as well as
for promoting works of modern Yiddish and Hebrew literature. This
poem is based on a projected plan of the Jewish underground to use the
lead of the printing plates for ammunition to stock its tiny arsenal. The
poemâ€™s images link the ghetto struggle with the ancient battles for
Jerusalem before the fall of the Temple.

The Lead Plates at the Rom Press

Arrayed at night, like fingers stretched through bars
To clutch the lit air of freedom,

We made for the press plates, to seize

The lead plates at the Rom printing works.

We were dreamers, we had to be soldiers,

And melt down, for our bullets, the spirit of the lead.

At some timeless native lair

We unlocked the seal once more.

Shrouded in shadow, by the glow of a lamp,
Like Temple ancients dipping oil

Into candelabrums of festal gold,

So, pouring out line after lettered line, did we.

Letter by melting letter the lead,

Liquefied bullets, gleamed with thoughts:

A verse from Babylon, a verse from Poland,
Seething, flowing into the one mold.

Now must Jewish grit, long concealed in words,
Detonate the world in a shot!

Who in Vilna Ghetto has beheld the hands
Of Jewish heroes clasping weapons

Has beheld Jerusalem in its throes,

The crumbling of those granite walls;
Grasping the words smelted into lead,
Conning their sounds by heart.

Vilna Ghetto,
