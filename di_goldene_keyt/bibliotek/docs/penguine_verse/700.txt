Knife. Father. The wood lamp smokes.
Childhood. Child. A shadow

Takes the fiddle down from the wall. Thin flakes
Of snowsound drift slowly over my head.

Quiet. Father is playing. The sounds
Engrave themselves in the air, as in the frost
Silver atoms of breath hang suspended

Blue over snow the moon has glazed.

Through the windowpane with its icy fur,
A wolf sniffs at the blood of the music.
Quiet. In our dovecote an unfledged bird
Picks its way out of the shell. Peck-peck.

Here 1 Am

Here I am, full-grown, flourishing.
It’s as if fiery bees had stung me with songs.
I heard you calling from the first light

And set out to you through darkness. Dust. Sweat.

Towns and villages fell away from me,
One flash of lightning set ablaze

My old gray home.

Rain washed away the last traces.
And I was left standing before your name
As before the blue

Mirror of conscience.

My hands, stripped branches,

Bang impatiently at your door.

Fresh with marvels,

My eyes are drawn to you like sails.
But suddenly: the door’s ajar.

You are not here.
