 

Yitskhok Leybush Perets

Everything’s suddenly fine.

Now here’s a client who knows how to pay!
The small change glitters, the dollars shine.
It’s raining credit

all around,

the roads are full

of the wagon sound

of peasants coming to town,

and ah! the wheeling and dealing

of slaughterers, judges, perpetual scholars
chasing the dollars,

buying and sending things on.

God blessed the shtet! with luck!

Golden times and daily display

of satin and silk, whatever impresses,
weddings every day in the week,

and every tailor up to his ears

in orders for wedding dresses.

All the musicians are worn out and weary,
the khupe is torn, the poles are

as dull as the guests, who haven't the strength
to laugh at the badkhn,

and there’s no wax left for havdoles.
Their hunger forgotten once and for all—
who eats bread or bothers to bake it?
Plum pastry, honey cake,

and liquor—a lake of it.

Now the German brought

an only daughter

with him—a jewel.

Golden hair falling to her feet,

and eyes as bright as stars,

so sweet,

khupe: wedding canopy.
badkhn: wedding entertainer.
havdoles: braided candles used at ritual marking conclusion of the Sabbath.
