26 Uri Tevi Greenberg

Endured two thousand years—of silence and of blood, and no
mouth ever spat against the poison.

And I don’t know what’s wrong.

Though there are books in which the Gentiles’ murders have
been written,

But there’s nothing written there about our answers to the
murders.

 

That forest of grief has grown; the trees are crowned with sorrow,
Dark and wild, and when the moon peers down, what terror.
And if a voice shouts, ‘‘Pain!’’ the sound’s a stone in water.
And the bleeding of the dead’s like dewdrops to the ocean.

Kingdom of the cross! Great Europe!

In the land of grief upon a sun-day, a black feast day in your
honor,

I'll open up that forest and I'll show you all the trees where hang

My decaying dead.

Kingdom of the Cross, be pleased.

Look and see my valleys:

The shepherds in a circle round the emptied wells;

Dead shepherds with their lambs’ heads on their knees.

It has been long since there was water in those wells instead
OF execration.

Dress me in a broad Arab abaya, and toss a tales over my shoulder,
And the extinguished East flames up in my poor blood.

Take back the frock coat, the tie, and the patent-leather shoes
I bought in Europe.

Set me on a horse and command it to race with me to the desert.
Yield me my sands again. Farewell to the boulevards. Let me have
my sands of the desert.

abaya: Arab outer garment.
tales (Heb. tallith): prayer shawl.
