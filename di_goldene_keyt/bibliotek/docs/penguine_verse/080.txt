 

52 Yitskhok Leybush Perets

First published in 1888 and rewritten at least four times, “Monish” ap-
pears here in its last condensed version of 1908. Perets’s revisions stripped
the poem of discursive passages on Yiddish language and traditional
Jewish behavior, refined the vocabulary of some Slavic elements, and
clipped the lines to a sharper staccato rhythm. Mixing elements of
autobiography with Jewish folklore, “Monish” dramatizes the exposure
of the traditional Jewish hero, the masterful student of the Law, to
modern secular temptation. It can also be read as a contest between two
schemes of art, the capitulation of religious culture to the aesthetic lure of
Germany or the West.

Monish

Life is like a river;

we are fish.

The water’s wholesome and fresh
and we would swim forever,

but for a black figure

on the riverbank.

There Satan stands,
in his hands

a fishing rod,

and catches fish.

With a worm that eats the dust,
a little lust,

a moment's pleasure,

the line is baited.

Hardly a flick

‎and the pike flies in the pan‏ יי
‎to be fried or roasted‏
‎on the flames of hell.‏

‎May his name be obliterated!
we know whose’work it is—
Satan’s—

‎and why it works so well.
The cause
