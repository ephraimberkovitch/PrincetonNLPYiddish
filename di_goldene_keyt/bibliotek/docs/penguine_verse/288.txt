This section of a longer poem, ‘In vinter farnakhin’” (On Winter Eve-
nings; 1912), is one of the best-known prerevolutionary Russian Yiddish
lyrics, In his wartime work, “Introduction to the Poem, 1944,” Hofshteyn
expressed wry satisfaction that these lines had remained popular among
Jewish soldiers at the front.

In Winter’s Dusk...

Russian fields on winter evenings!
Where can one be more lonely, where can one be more lonely. .. .

An old horse wheezing and a sleigh creaking,
and I half-way along a snow-covered road.

Below, in the only pale corner of twilight,
sad streaks of light dying and smoldering.

Before us stretching a desert of whiteness,
and sown in its vastness a scatter of houses.
Sunk in its snow-depths a farmhouse dreaming. . . .

Many paths leading to a house like the others,
to a little Jewish house, but its windows larger.
Among all the children I am the oldest.

My little world narrow, my circumference tiny—
only once in two weeks to visit the village.

In silence longing for the fields in the distance,
for the paths and the by-paths wind-blown and snow-covered...

And concealed in the heart the sorrow of seedlings
that keep waiting, keep waiting their time of sowing. .. .

Russian fields on winter evenings!
Where can one be more lonely, where can one be more lonely?
