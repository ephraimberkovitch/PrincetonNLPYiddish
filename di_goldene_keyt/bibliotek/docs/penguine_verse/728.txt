 

700 Abraham Sutzkever

In his moist marble pupils, burnished and black,
that rege struck like a star: yellow patch
Russia’s poet had, for a moment, to bear.

The snow was still there.

Yanova Bartoszewicz was a Polish woman who hid Sutzkever in her cellar
and brought food to his family in the Vilna Ghetto during a period of
mass liquidation in late October 1941. Sutzkever planted a tree in her
memory in the Avenue of the Righteous Gentiles, part of the Yad Vashem
Memorial in Jerusalem.

And when I go up as a pilgrim in winter, to recover

the place I was born, and the twin to self I am in my mind,
then I’ll go in black snow as a pilgrim to find

the grave of my savior, Yanova.

She'll hear what I whisper, under my breath:

Thank you. You saved my tears from the flame.

Thank you. Children and grandchildren you rescued from death.
I planted a sapling (it doesn’t suffice) in your name.

Time in its gyre spins back down the flue

faster than nightmares of nooses can ride,

quicker than nails. And you, my savior, in your cellar you'll hide
me, ascending in dreams as a pilgrim to you.

You'll come from the yard in your slippers, crunching the snow

so I'll know. Again I’m there in the cellar, degraded and low,

you're bringing me milk and bread sliced thick at the edge.

You’re making the sign of the cross. I’m making my pencil its
pledge.
