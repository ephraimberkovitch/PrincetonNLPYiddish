cheerfully

like beer flowing from

the open spout of a keg.

The grass along its banks

was matted and wet.

He laid the net in by its nose

to keep it from being carried off.
And J ran back upstream

a little way with the paddle

and slapped and beat the water.

I slapped and I ran fast,

yelling out loud,

and poked at the slimy banks,
wherever a fish was drowsing,
until water turned to ink

and foamed—like fallen snow.
And when he hauled it in,

the net was filled with water-eyes,
and through the loops, stuck halfway out,
fish peered as if through windows
and wriggled their tails coquettishly
before dry death.

The First Cigarette

My first Sabbath cigarette between my lips
one frosty Friday night

didn’t taste awfully good.

I snorted and I coughed

but had to give it a drag.

This I took to be my first transgression.

So too Shloime Raskoser’s son
got up from his mother’s Sabbath table
to eat pig at the Gentile’s place.
