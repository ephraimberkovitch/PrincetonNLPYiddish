hollow words, and dead—

we who once went mooning

(but now the dream’s undone)

for a Great Assembly of our own?

Sabbath

In boyhood once I rated

one of my Sabbaths—an ordinary day,
and desecrated—against the hallowed way
my father kept his. Even then I knew
how mine sped like short Friday to

its end. My father’s Sabbath waned

as if it had a year to spend.

His Sabbath rest gave full weight.

I profaned the day.

The more I broke it, the faster it fled.
Each boyish breach made it fly away.
My father sang, studied, prayed—

in a single Sabbath could fit so much!
Bliss lit him; his eyes would touch
my mother with new love.

In boyhood once I slipped like a shadow
after my father’s Sabbath

with all its laws,

tunes, heartfelt limits, happy ways;

that Jewish rest wore me out.

Great Assembly: in Hebrew, the kneset hagdola, the Jewish judicial and admini-

strative authority at the beginning of the Second Temple period, which in-
troduced the classification of the Oral Law.

Sabbath: Short Friday is the Friday closest to December 21, when all preparations

for Sabbath must be completed in the shortest number of daylight hours.
