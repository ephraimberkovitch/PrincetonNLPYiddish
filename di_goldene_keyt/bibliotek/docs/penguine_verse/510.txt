and in the copperlight my brown bread-loaf lies gleaming,
and on its back flies dancing, dancing and buzzing: bzzz.
The knife is glittering. The spoon glows silver.

I'd like to start digging in. I’m hungry and thirsty, faint
from walking the streets—

The white door opens, and what comes in? A lump,
cheeks sunken, eyes bulging (it’s the loneliness).

A gnarled and hairy hand extends, imploring:

I’m hungry and thirsty, tired

from walking the streets.

I invite the lump to sit in my chair and eat.

So the lump sits down and eats and chews like an animal,
and having finished slithers toward the door,

licking his lips: how good—

his grimy face all grin, his eyes grown green.

And when he leaves and the white door locks behind him,

its whiteness stirs, and something

trembles into life: two horn-tips first, and then a white, dead
brow.

It twitches, twitches, lugs itself up until

the eyebrows show. A moment later,

and two pear-green eyes squint forth.

Spear-sharp they look at me and try to laugh—

and having looked—it’s finished. The door is white. Midday.

In the quiet room the copperlight lies outspread. And I am
smoking.

The biting flies fly around, buzzing venomously.

My gums grow dry, my thoughts spill over.
