356 Perets Markish

Ah, thou kid of the ascending sun,
Traded for two gulden,
I'm at your circumcision feast again.

Ah, you, my blind fathers,

How many bloated wombs,

How many debaucheries have borne me?
Then why am I afraid to take

A step into the ripped world?

Hey, boundaries of the earth! Spread.

The mill wheel turns from Nile to Dnieper now.
You, with spiked eyes,

Leap, mound, wild fever,

Over threshold, over ditches.

Blind Samson, blinded hero,

Hair’s sprouting on your head again.
Leap upon a bow; on firebrands.
Make the distance tremble

And topple all the world.

Sunk to the loins in silence, the town sits
Like an upturned empty wagon in a marsh.
Ah, if only one would come

To say something.

Ah, grief and woe. The sunset, like a weeping hawk
Sits on the blind roof of an entreating palm.
Ah, Almightiest of the world,
Open—open up your starry title page.
Hineni, he’oni. Unworthy, here I stand.

Hineni he’oni: Here am I, poor in worthy deeds,” the reader’s meditation that
precedes the recital of the Musaf service on Yom Kippur morning. Of un-
known authorship, the prayer asks that the congregation not be held respon-
sible for the iniquities of their representative in prayer, and pleads for God's
love to draw a veil over all wrongdoing.
