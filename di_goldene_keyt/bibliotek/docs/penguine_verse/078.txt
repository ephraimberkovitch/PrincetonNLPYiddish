and rhythm. Those who read Yiddish will be able to compare the
approaches of the various translators, some of whom tilt toward
the literal and others toward the liberal. Aware of how terribly dif-
ficult their task is, we have not tried to impose upon our trans-
lators any fixed pattern or formula, other than to hope that the
result of their work might be a poem in English.

This anthology is being completed at a moment when it seems all
too clear that the phase of Jewish culture in which Yiddish
flourished seems to be approaching its end. The number of Yiddish
readers keeps declining. There are no replacements for the poets
who leave us. A fragile remnant of the culture of Yiddish survives,
largely through the love and will of a small number of writers and
readers; but each day its position becomes more precarious. This is
the simple truth, and sad as it makes us, there is no point in deny-
ing it. But we would also affirm that in its tormented decades Yid-
dish literature has left us with a body of splendid and varied work.
What will remain? A Yiddish poet answers:

... The wind will stay,
and the blind man’s blindness when he’s gone away,
and a thread of foam—a sign of the sea—
and a bit of cloud snarled in a tree.

... A word as green
as Genesis, making grasses grow. .
