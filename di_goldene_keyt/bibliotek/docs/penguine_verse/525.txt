MALKA HEIFETZ
TUSSMAN

(Kheyfets Tuzman) 1896, Bolshaya-Chaitcha,
Ukraine.

fter coming to America in 1912, Tussman became a teacher in

a secular Yiddish school in Milwaukee and studied at the
University of Wisconsin. Later she moved to Los Angeles and then
to Berkeley, California. Since 1918 she has published poems,
stories, and essays in American and European Yiddish magazines;
her first book of poems appeared in 1949. Strongly personal and
feminine, Tussmanâ€™s poetry often achieves a dramatic strength in
its address to a recipient (the reader, or God).
