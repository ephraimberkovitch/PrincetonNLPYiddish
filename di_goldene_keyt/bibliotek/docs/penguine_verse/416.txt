From Byelorussia
Grandpa and the Uncles. . .

Ah, my grandpa in Kubelnik is a simple sort of fellow;

A farmer with a horse and with an ax and with a sheepskin.

As common as the clay are all

My sixteen uncles and my father,

Hauling logs out of the forest; driving rafts upon the river.

They toil the livelong day like ordinary peasants,

Then eat their supper of an evening gathered round a single
platter;

And fall into their sixteen beds like sheaves of grain—together.

Grandpa—ah, my grandpa ... he can hardly climb the oven .

Half asleep at supper, his poor old eyes kept closing;

And yet, his feet have somehow found their own way to the
oven;

My grandpa’s loyal feet which served him for so many years.

Leonard Wolf

Uncle Avram Pastures the Horses .

At night, Uncle Avram looked after the horses.

He had food in his sack; and was wrapped in a sheepskin
From which only his legs showed, stretched toward the fire
Beside which he sat like a stump, and as silent.

That was the way that he pastured the horses. . . .

They, impeded by hobbles, clumped through the meadow
Where the shimmering moonlight touched the mares gently
And the fog-shrouded Niemen distantly sounded.

Niemen (Neman): This river, running through White Russia and Lithuania into
the Baltic Sea, was a route for log rafts.
