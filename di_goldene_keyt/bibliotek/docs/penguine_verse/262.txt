234 H. Leivick

Parted from whom?
From whom fled?
Let the riddle slip
unsaid.

 

The circling plain
is fire and flame:
fiery snow

on the hills.

Look—this open door
and gate. Guess.
Hospital? Prison?
some monkish place?

Colorado! I throw
my sack of despair
on your fiery floor
of snow.

Cynthia Ozick

A Stubborn Back—And Nothing More

Come, let us hide ourselves in caves,

in stony crevices, in graves

where stretched full length on the hard ground
we lie, backs up and faces down.

We shall not record, we shall not say
why we've immured ourselves this way.
No notch in a wall, our stony page,
shall mark the historic year or age.

We shall not leave behind as clue
one thread of ourselves—not the lace of a shoe.

No one shall find, hard though he look,

one shred of a dress, one page of a book.
