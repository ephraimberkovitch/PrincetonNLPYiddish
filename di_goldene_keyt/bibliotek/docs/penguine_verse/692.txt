Judd Teller

We are of the same blood.

Pull a stalk from me,

as from sheaves of oats at markets.
Tell me the answer.

Minor

The night is blue, the blanket
spotted with white.

My wife is porcelain, and |
am hail on the window.

Our dream repeats our day.

You are right, friends.
You reek of revolution
like brandy,

and you aren’t even dizzy.

When your stones strike her window,
damned if I'll be sorry.

Grace Schulman

Budapest

Under Lenin’s portrait,

a Hapsburg orchestra.

Like fish in a tank,

bureaucrats, tourists, and brokers
sit at dressed tables

on an open terrace.
