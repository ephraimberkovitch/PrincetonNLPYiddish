 

Yankev-Yitskhok Segal

one thousand times,

dividing sacred and profane.

Still, in my mind’s eye

are two Korets rabbis:

one old, with a white beard,

the other young, with a short blond beard,
both from Lithuania, Byelorussia.
Everyone in town knew them,

and they met occasionally in the market:
“Good day, Reb Mordecai.”

“Good day to you, Yisroel.”’

And they would stand and talk
smoothly, so elegantly

that everyone blessed and cherished them
in reverence,

and the summer day was radiant.

I see it now, gleaming from there;

in the market, the noise wanes,

and the old beggar plays piously

on a thin string

near a ditch;

I can hear the sun’s golden drone

in its passage across the sky

over the old Korets marketplace.
