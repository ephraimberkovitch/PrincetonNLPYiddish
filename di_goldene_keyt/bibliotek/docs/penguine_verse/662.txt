634 Gabriel Preil

Sober

The paperâ€™s whiteness

is one with the night.

A landscape that makes wounds
more lucid than mornings.
Something must shake me

Out of my white imprisonment.

No restraint. No consoling
myself with fine words.
Not the sleepy fork

of a small pond,

or even a season,

already used,

that sweetened things once,
but a beginning

that burns hellishly white,

like frost that bites,

takes over

and rises up stronger

than rhetorical summers:

the challenge of sober paper.

Grace Schulman

The Surprised Pen

Young trees rise

like exclamation points.
Opposite, old women sit
content as full stops

that follow long sentences
heavy with meaning,

and pigeons enclose

in a parenthesis
