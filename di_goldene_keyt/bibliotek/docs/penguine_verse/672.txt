Poetry

True poetry sometimes likes to ride

on the healthy plain horse of prose.

The steeds whinny for joy, they don’t even feel the rider’s burden;
they think: moon princesses have come to visit on ordinary

saddles. .
Royal children are both modest and full of poses.

Princesses sometimes like to wander into kitchens

where, together with the servants, they dunk rye bread in earthen
bowls. .

Their royal blue blood shines against the black earth of coarse
flour

with an even bluer bloom; and among the garlic smells

their white lily skin has a scent even more aristocratic.

OF course true poetry besides being childishly innocent
is also modern and refined.

It is exactly like God’s-true-world,

where opposites

combine for charm.

But in the end, after long extravagant roaming,

it turns—poetry turns—from all its somersaults with form
back to the ancient blue flagon waiting at home

in God's fatherly bosom.
