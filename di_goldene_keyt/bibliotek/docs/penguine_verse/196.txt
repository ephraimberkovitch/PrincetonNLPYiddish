Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

I don’t care for the fire that burns

In the diamonds they flash on their hands.
I don’t care for their love, or a lust

That too quickly uncovers a breast.

I don’t care for their wealth. It disdains
Whatever is thoughtful or yearns.

But the world is much more than this town.
Travel a bit—look around.

I know that the world is broad

And rich in meadow and wood.

But I cannot persuade myself now
Is the time to shake loose and to go.
On the other hand, just staying here
Is more than a man ought to bear.

So I wait for a bolt from above

And I live like a zombie who moves
Swaying and lost through the house
In a world of mistakes, still a corpse.

Leonard Wolf

The first published version of this poem appeared in the satirical review
Der Kibitzer in 1911. Rewritten several times, it became one of Halpern’s
most famous self-characterizations, a provocative repudiation of the
dominant artistic preference for refinement and lyrical subtlety.

The Street Drummer

The bird sings free and clear, alone,
There the king trembles on his throne.
Trembling is too absurd:

I sing freely as the bird;

And as fast

As the wind’s blast
