1886, Zloczéw, then Galicia—1932, New York.

 

 

ing in Vienna as a commercial artist. Originally associated with
Di Yunge, he was also a contributor to anti-aestheticist satirical
magazines like Der Kibitzer and Der Grosyer Kundes (The Big
Stick), where he cultivated the role of rebel and social critic. Over
the years, Halpern developed a number of literary personae, in-
cluding Moyshe-Leyb, the takhshit, or “jewel”; Zarkhi, the
philosophical aging immigrant; and the accursed poet, whom the
evil of the world does not inhibit from playing at versification.

In the 1920s he was briefly attached to the Communist daily
Freiheit and was involved in the argument over “proletarian
poetry,” but his individualistic temperament precluded ideological
conformity. The internal struggle in his verse between tender con-
cern and disgust for the human condition expressed itself in
imagery of increasing density and complexity. Often considered
the most original and distinctive voice in Yiddish poetry, he
employed a low, idiomatic diction that influenced poets as different
as Itsik Manger and Jacob Glatstein.
