172 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

Inured to all with an evil name,

From my pocket I pinch some bread
And swig from my flask; down from my head
The sweat pours, and my blood’s aflame.
So as if to break

The drum, I bang

And then I make

The cymbals clang

And round and round about I spin—
Boom! Boom! Din-din-din!

Boom! Boom! Din!

That’s the way I’ve torn on through,
Torn my way, and bitten, too,

With my head as through a wall,
Cross-country, over roads and all.
Break the stone

With tooth and bone!

Break the stone and stay alone!

Dog and bum, clod and wind so wild;
Reckless and free, on alien dirt,

I have no coat, I have no shirt,

I have no wife and I have no child.
So as if to break

The drum, I bang

And then I make

The cymbals clang

And round and round about I spin—
Boom! Boom! Din-din-din!

Boom! Boom! Din!
