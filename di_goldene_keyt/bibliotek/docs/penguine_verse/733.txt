BIBLIOGRAPHY

his bibliography provides the sources of our Yiddish texts, in the

order in which the poems are presented. We tried to find the most
authoritative text for each poem. Wherever the Yiddish text provided ex-
act or approximate dating for the poem, we put this information in
parentheses. Thus, for example, Itsik Manger’s Lid un balade arranges
the author’s Selected Poems according to the volumes in which they
originally appeared. The dates in this case indicate the first appearance of
each poem in book form, though not necessarily the date of original
publication.

Our selection from Soviet Yiddish poetry is based mainly on the
anthology A shpigl oyf a shteyn, edited by Kh. Shmeruk. The bibli-
ographical information contained in that volume was used for the dates of
those poems.

Whenever a poet dated a work personally, the reference is provided on
the page of the poem itself.
