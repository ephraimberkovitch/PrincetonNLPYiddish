Ten Commandments.

My grandfather’s kinsman, a Jew who tamed bears,
Performed in the market towns;

By day his beast was confined in chains;

At night, they danced under the stars.

Nicknamed ‘Ten Commandments,” the man was bald,
With long bony hands to his knees;

He was hunch-backed and scruffy and sweaty and old
And he stank of fur like a beast.

Traveling the roads with his bear at night,
The man led, the bear followed behind.

If a shoeless peasant chanced to walk by,
The bear grumbled and rattled his chain.

The burial society washed off the blood

Of ‘Ten’ ‘s wives who all died in great pain,

For he stripped them naked and lashed them by night
Till their grief was heard by the town.

His thirteenth wife, who passed for a witch in Lithuania,
A year after their marriage bore him a daughter;

For years, he drained his wife's strength, then the witch
Too was laid out on a stretcher.

“Ten Commandments” he was, a man who tamed bears
And performed in the market towns;

By day his beast was confined in chains;

At night they danced under the stars.
