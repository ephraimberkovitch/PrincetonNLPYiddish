Water Without Sound

The sea

tore a rib from its side
and said:

Go! Lie down there, be
a sign that I

am great and mighty.
Go

be a sign.

The canal
lies at my window,
speechless.

What can be sadder
than water
without sound?

Marcia Falk

Songs of the Priestess

Gather me up
like wheat.

Cut quickly

and bind me

before autumn’s whirlwind
sweeps me away.

Hurry—
I am fully ripe
and all the fences are down.

Don’t be afraid—
I don’t have to grow any more.
