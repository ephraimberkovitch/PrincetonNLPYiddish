 

450 Jacob Glatstein

Through disciplined hunger,

I came at last to the taste of bread and butter
And corporeal thinking.

I went, and my body went with me,

And there wasn’t a single thought

That couldn’t shine through my skin and bones.
I clambered about and my feet clambered with me.
Several of my speculations gleamed

Unusually ordinary.

And, as night fell,

Further hunger brought me to bread alone,

And to think joyfully,

I, in the dark, by myself,

Some rare, somnolent simplicities

Which, if they chance to be holy,

Sanctify and make sleepy

Feet and hands and head.

And today, I jumped up, famished,

And on an empty stomach, I began

With absolute nothing.

And the day also grew

Out of practically nothing—out of black and all but, all but
blue.

And, to my dark limbs

I decreed: Let there be light,

And we both acquired luminous wings—

I, and the day,

And we both became one,

And we both prayed aloud with a single voice,
“How goodly are Thy tents... .”

“How goodly are Thy tents”: Numbers 24:5, the first blessing of the morning
prayers.
