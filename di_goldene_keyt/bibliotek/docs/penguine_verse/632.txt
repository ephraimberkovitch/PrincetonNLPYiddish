604 Aba Shtoltsenberg

Someone, pacing his floor,

asks for fire and wind.

Someone is scared on his doorstep,

floor a pit, wall prison,

and someone notes a heap of earth, a weeping tree,
and quivers as if shot

through space.

Dream Canaan

And Canaan? How d’you get there?
Easy, in a dream, to get there.

Not boat, or train, or frightening Turk—
with a lump of bread and an apple

down garden, scurried up field,

thought through fence and over wall,

I put up my collar because of Jordan chill,
sit down on a sandy hill a bit.

Mounted Ishmaelites snatch off my cap

and chasing I fall into a cellar.

Bottled syrup, soda-jerk Joseph, two

snakes clang cymbals, a blind beggar fiddles.

In circling dream this cellar... two saws saw

in desert, over heaped stones, quite near Beth-El.
Wearing a brilliant head scarf and a laundered apron,
Mother Rachel gets up to say hello.

Canaan: ancient region lying between the Jordan, the Dead Sea, and the Mediter-
ranean; the land promised by God to Abraham (Genesis 12:5—10).

Ishmaelites: nomadic tribe on borders of ancient Israel, traditionally considered
descendants of Ishmael, son of Abraham.

syrup: conjectural, the meaning of this line in the original text is not certain.
