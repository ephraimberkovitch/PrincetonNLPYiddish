46 Jacob Glatstein

The year 1919 was filled with many bloody events trumpeted by extra edi-
tions of daily newspapers (referred to in the poem): the conclusion of the
First World War, pogroms against Jews in Poland and the Ukraine, the
civil war in Russia,

Using the traditional form of Jewish nomenclature and the familiar
diminutive Yankl, the poem refers to the poet Jacob, son of Isaac—
names that echo the biblical source of their lineage. The “tiny round par-
ticle’’—or dot—that remains of the old-country Jewish son can be taken
as a reference to the Yiddish expression dos pintele yid, the essential
crumb of Jewishness that is said to remain within even the most as-
similated Jew. Literally, the dot of the letter yad—pronounced as i—is the
smallest vowel sign of the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet.

1919

No trace left these last days

of Yankl, Reb Isaac’s son:

only a tiny round particle

wheeling annoyingly through the streets,
thrashing clumsy stumps.

The great lord ringed the whole earth
with sky blue.

And no rescue.

From high up, Extras fall all over,
squashing my soggy head.

One with a long tongue

splattered my glasses

with a permanent splotch of red.

Red, red, red.

Listen:

These days somehow my skull bursts and flames
in a density of uproar, leaving behind
a little heap of dirty ash.

Tiny round particle,

I'll swirl in eternities of ether
swathed in red veils.
