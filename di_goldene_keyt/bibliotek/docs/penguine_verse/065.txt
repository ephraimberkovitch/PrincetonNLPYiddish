Introduction 37

on August 12, 1952, Bergelson, Markish, Hofshteyn, Kvitko,
Fefer, and Shmuel Persov were executed by the Stalinist regime.

Put aside the agitprop fictions and verses these writers were
forced to publish, and there still remains a significant body of work
by the Soviet Yiddish novelists and poets. The Stalinist terror
thwarted their careers, as it destroyed many of their lives; but im-

By the 1920s the modernist impulse began to dominate Yiddish
poetry. In New York a number of young Yiddish poets—not im-
migrant shop workers, like Di Yunge of early years, but students
and intellectuals—formed in 1920 the group called In Zikh
(Introspectivists). That aesthetic autonomy for which Di Yunge
had fought so hard, the leaders of In Zikh, Jacob Glatstein and
