698 Abraham Sutzkever

The funeral’s early, the concert is late.
I go to both (such is my fate),

to play at the pairing of music with clay:
a pail of good fortune, a pail of dismay.

 

Together, together, the that and the this,
and a beam of light curving to swim the abyss.

Such is the link of the scythe to the ground,
such is the union of fiddler and sound.

Here is the binding of now and of then,
Here is the coupling of women with men.

Sutzkever met the Russian poet Boris Pasternak when he was in Moscow
(1944-45). Pasternak (1890-1960), of Jewish parentage but totally es-
tranged from Judaism, translated some of Sutzkever’s poems into Rus-
sian. Familiar with German, Pasternak could understand all the words of
Germanic and Slavic derivation, but not the word rege, from the Hebrew
component of Yiddish.

1976

Remembrance of Pasternak:.the earth of his forelock

in new Moscow snow. Red shawl at the throat. As though
Pushkin had entered . . . something it was he felt in the air.
The snow was still there.

He gave me his hand, entrusting a key

made of fingers. Across, his face nervous yet potent:

“Read on in your Yiddish. I can follow the sounds that we share.”
The snow was still there.

I read my coals plucked from hell. “A rege fell

like a star’’—he understood everything well, except rege:
“moment” in Hebrew. He could stretch, but not snare.
The snow was still there.
