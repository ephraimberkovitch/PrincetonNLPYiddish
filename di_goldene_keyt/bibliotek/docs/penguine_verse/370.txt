342 Yisroel Shtern

The third night looks down:
Still—still.
Streets—
shops—
poles—
parks—
still—still.
A path—
a bridge—
a stream—
a mill—
still, still.

But somewhere near a fence

creeps someone bent.

Is it the watchman?

Is it a thief?

A watchman maybe who’s also a thief?

The third night looks down
and at her side the clouds
drift, drift, wobbling as they drift.

When someone asks me who I am,
I send that someone to my nights.
