Sacrifice

Bound hand and foot he lies
on the hard altar stone
and waits.

Eyes half shut, he looks
on his father standing there
and waits.

His father sees his eyes
and strokes his son’s brow
and waits.

 

With old and trembling hands
the father picks up the knife
and waits.

A Voice from above cries, “Stop!”
The hand freezes in air
and waits.

The veined throat suddenly throbs
with the miracle of the test
and waits.

The father gathers up the son.
The altar is bare
and waits.

Ensnared in thorns a lamb
looks at the hand with a knife
and waits.
