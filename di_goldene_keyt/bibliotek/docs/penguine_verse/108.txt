Yitskhok Leybush Perets

he sinfully speaks the name of God
and is struck by the thunder of His rod.

Laughter in Gehenna,

a reek of sulfur in the room,

and fast as a bowshot

he flies through the air on a broom.

Ararat goes crazy—

one hilarious, profuse
shrieking party in the ark,
all Gehenna breaking loose.

Ten gypsy orchestras,

Gehenna’s top musicians,

champagne by the bucket

while the demons do the can-can with precision.

Lamps—a thousand barrels full of pitch—

the wicked are the wicks—

and a special sexton with his scissors at the ready
goes a-trimming wicked wicks

to keep them burning steady.

Fire in her eyes,

the queen of all that place,

Lilith goes before, Sammael behind,
carrying her train of Spanish lace.

Monish stands at the side, nailed by his earlobe
to the doorway of the ark;

the fire’s lit, the spit is ready,

and the rest is dark.
