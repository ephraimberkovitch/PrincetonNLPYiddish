They tricked You out in stars over a whole universe.
How is it that great nations flock to You?
You are quiet and content with your own.
You are one of us,

completely.

Why did You abandon your closet-ark,
your little tent,

going far away to be converted

into the Lord of the Universe?

Therefore we became Your errant children,
agitators of pillars, world incendiaries.

You lapsed into the Jewish International
before we did.

We followed You into Your wide world
and sickened there.

Save Yourself, return

with Your pilgrims who go up

to a little land. Come back,

be our Jewish God again.

Yiddishkayt

Yiddish poets,

why such yearning

after what remembered burning
of Sabbath candles turning

to tapers round a bier?

Itâ€™s only pity here,

Yiddishkayt: the term here points to a concept of worldly or secular Jewish
culture.

tapers round a bier: candles were placed at the head of a corpse during the
time before its burial.
