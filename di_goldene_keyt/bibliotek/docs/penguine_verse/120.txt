Children’s Games

It happens sometimes when the children play,
You come upon them and you guess that they
Think your own serious life’s another game;
And you grow thoughtful while you study them.

One child, with blue paper, makes a phone,
Then dials the name and number of someone
Entirely imagined; all unreal—

And yet you hear the child complete the call.

Then with a charming smile, he says goodbye—

As anybody might—as you and I.

Then he mounts his little horse; and shouts the name
Of your own distant city as he rides away.

Leonard Wolf

The Last Street

The last street of the town;
And there the final house.
The place seems like a joke
After the city’s noise.

The neighbors are so hushed,

Each house so small—

Which makes the fields seem broad,
The sky especially full.

And everywhere you look
Your eyes with pleasure shine.
Here where city ends,

The world begins.
