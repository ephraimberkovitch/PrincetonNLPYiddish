562 ltsik Manger

The first four poems form part of Medresh Itsik, Manger’s playful ex-
egetical renditions of well-known biblical episodes. While the stories and
homilies of traditional midrash were often unintentionally anachronistic,
Manger used anachronism as one of several techniques to show the ten-
sion between the grandeur of the Bible and the east European Jew’s ex-
perience of it in exile.

Eve and the Apple Tree

She stands before the apple tree
While the red sun sets.

Mother Eve, what do you know,
What do you know of death?

Death, ah, death’s the apple tree
Whose weary limbs bend down,
It is the bird upon the branch
Singing an evensong.

Adam’s to the wild wood gone
At dawn into the wood.

Adam says, “The wood is wild
And all that’s wild is good.”

But Eve is frightened of the wood,
Prefers the apple tree,

And when she does not go to it,
It comes to her in dreams.

Tt rustles, it leans over her,

It says, “Beloved Eve,

Not every warning Word He speaks
Has to be believed.’’

In love, she plucks an apple—

She feels strangely light.

Round and round the tree she goes
Like a butterfly in flight.
