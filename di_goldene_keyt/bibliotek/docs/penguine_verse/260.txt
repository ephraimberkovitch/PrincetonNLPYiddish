and come

to tear and gnaw.

Instead, I hunch into myself,
my head between my feet.

Back to my cave.

A lump on a cot. Alone.

But far from asleep,

as tireless of holding in my teeth
the holy poem

as the wolf

his solitary bone.

Robert Friend

Written during a period of recuperation from tuberculosis at a sanatorium
in Denver, Colorado, this poem is part of a series entitled Poems from
Paradise’’ (1932-36).

Sanatorium

Gate, open;
doorsill, creep near.
Room, I’m here;
back to the cell.

Fire in my flesh,
snow on my skull.
My shoulder heaves
a sack of grief.

Good-bye. Good-bye.
Hand. Eye.
Burning lip
charred by good-bye.
