 

Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

This part of the country? The sky, blue everywhere,
And I love you everywhere, my wife; but care

And weariness in me becloud your beauty

Like the smoke of the train on the blue sky.

A stranger who might read these verses through
Would probably think: What a peculiar Jew—
Likens his wife to sky and summer birds

And himself to smoke and nettles.

I say this loud and clear: to this good stranger
I stick my tongue out, and I give the finger
So that he won’t, O my beloved wife,

Give you the eye from such a distance.

But watch yourself in any case; don’t be
The one to let your head get turned by me
With blue sky and summer birds

Among the New York trolley cars.

It won’t be long now, and I'll soon be back.
My train whistles on the hilly stretch of track
Near Cincinnati, that lies deep below

Poised like some perilous spittoon.

I laugh myself: I like the simile,

And only hope my little pleasantry

Won't end up, somehow, with egg on its face.
You know precisely the kind of jerk I am.

Meanwhile, wherever I go, there’s not one thing
I lack, except your head, to which I cling
When I want to tantalize your little mouth
That longs for mine.

Soon, soon, as I told you. Now I am more
Than a thousand miles nearer you than before.
Give my best to New York—a lousy town

But not too bad, if you have someone there.

John Hollander
