Spinoza, fool and lunatic—Baruch, the so-called blessed

and luminous, throw him to the dogs, that Benedict,

that traitorous pig’s-brain!

Hell, beating, prison, public shame be on his head!

Dear God Almighty, that he dared defy you,

to spit upon your Name. One sin begets another!

(This from Solomon Morteira, merchant, trembling with rancor
and hate.)

A little Jew shrieks: Look, there he is, he’s coming,

he’s here, he himself, ay!

Just look at him, let me be the first to spit in his face!

The young bosoms of the Jewish daughters quake with fear,

the housewives weep, a voice calls out:

It’s not true! and again the little Jew:

from all sides they're beating him!

—It can’t be true—you're dreaming—where, who?

Suddenly Hanan the beadle thunders in a voice

loud enough to make the chandeliers dance:

He—will—not—come—today—

and almost by itself the orn koydesh comes to life

and moves; then all is quiet.

Tekiah, intones the leader of the congregation,

and his eyes glaze; tekiah, the shoyfer sighs and groans,

and the congregation sighs and groans in answer.

Then in a hoarse voice the shoykhet begins to chant the
prayers,

(men curse, women cry, and children scream)

on the sixth day of Av, 5416.

orn koydesh, tekiah, shoyfer, shoykhet: As part of the ritual of excommunica-
tion, the ram’s horn, shoyfer (Heb. shofar), is blown before the orn koydesh
(Heb., aron kadosh), the ark containing the scrolls of the law. Tekiah is the
blast of the shoyfer. A shoykhet is a ritual slaughterer, who here also func-
tioned as prayer leader.
