JACOB GLATSTEIN

(Yankev Glatshteyn) 1896, Lublin, Poland—1971,
New York.

oming to America in 1914, Glatstein studied law at New York

University, where he befriended the poets N. B. Minkoff and
Aaron Glants-Leyeles, co-founders of the magazine In Zikh
(literally, Inside the Self). His early poems, influenced by psy-
choanalytic theories of the unconscious and by the modernist
break with cultural continuity, fulfilled the Introspectivist plat-
form of “individuality in everything and introspection in
everything.” In time, and particularly after a visit to Poland in
1934, his poetry drew more powerfully from Jewish tradition and
contemporary Jewish concerns. His verbal wit and cultural al-
lusiveness gained depth from this fresh exposure to his own and
the common Jewish past. One of the most cosmopolitan and intel-
lectual of Jewish writers, he also excelled at political journalism and
literary criticism, wrote short stories and novels, edited literary
magazines, and for some years stood at the center of American Yid-
dish cultural activity.
