132 Mani Leyb

This sonnet lamenting the murdered Jews of Europe recalls the melodies
of a fallen civilization. The song of the splendid peacock is a well-known
Yiddish folk song; the song of Elimelekh the King is a modern version of
Old King Cole, transmuted by the American Yiddish poet Moishe Nadir
(lizkhok Rayz, 1885—-1943) to resemble a Hasidic song. The biblical cym-
bals suggest the ancient music of the Jews, while the appropriate trope to
which the Torah is read represents the musical tradition of the synagogue.
The nine sonnets by Mani Leyb translated here are part of a loose se-
quence written during the last twenty years of his life.

They...

There had been multitudes, yea, multitudes, O God—
So many lively ones, and so many gallant,

So stately and so bearded, and so crowned with talent—
Whose language was astonishing, and nobly odd.

From under every rooftop with its gabled slopes

Such curious songs, and such haughty ones they'd sing,
Of the splendid peacock and Elimelekh the King,

With biblical cymbals, and the appropriate tropes.

But high above their heads, only the sun could see
The raw attack, the cold knife of the murderer

As he descended on them in a violent stir,

And what a lot there was of savage butchery. . . .

Now they are melted, they are what violence can remember,
Two or three trees left standing amid the fallen timber.

John Hollander

You Only Know...

You're full, sated with wonder as with bread,
Sated with days—a full river that goes
Beyond your eye, around the earth, and flows
With light that God’s eternal lamp has shed.
