‎GREENBERG‏

1896, Biaty Kamien, Poland—1981, Tel Aviv.

1920s—Perets Markish, Melech Ravitch, I. J. Singer
—had seen action in the First World War, including Greenberg,
who served in the Austrian army and deserted in 1917. A poet in
Hebrew and Yiddish, he was part of Di Khaliastre (The Gang) of
defiant expressionists, but he also wrote delicate late-romantic
lyrics. In 1924 he settled in Palestine. After the Arab riots of 1929
he joined the Revisionist Zionist Party and went to Poland
(1931-35) to assist in its work. He became a member of the Israeli
Knesset for the Herut Party in 1949.

Greenberg is one of the most powerful elegists of modern
literature. He differs from other Yiddish poets in also venting his
fury against the marauding representatives of “the Cross and
the Crescent.”
