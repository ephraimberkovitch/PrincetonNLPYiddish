We didn’t integrate
with the native scum—
we rushed to emigrate.

Sunday Shtetl

Rabbi Levi Yitskhok’s drayman—the one who wore
tales and tfiln as he smeared the wheels

of his wagon with tar—

turns up in the shape of a bunch of Jews

hanging around their houses,

washing the car

(while the shtetl drowses

in its Sunday snooze),

adding up bills and working out deals

to pay up what's owed to the pinochle fund-raiser
they attended last night at the Center.

A hushed hand feeds the ache
of this chronic languor
that drops on the town:
weekly monotonous logic,
once out of seven.

In the little square

the clock creeps on

to point the dawn;

a wary church bell wakes
its passive god.

Windows start the stench
of bacon crackling.

Rabbi Levi Yitskhok of Berdichev (c. 1740—1810): a famous Hasidic rabbi, noted

for his benign view of humankind. The story goes that he once saw a
drayman, arrayed for the morning service in his prayer shawl and
phylacteries, greasing the wheels of his wagon. ‘Lord of the Universe,” he
exclaimed with delight, “behold the devoutness of your people! Even when
they grease the wheels of a wagon they are still mindful of your name!”
(Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim)
