The following two poems are untitled in the original Yiddish and are
therefore left so in the English translation.

* 6 8

Dead Gentile women in greatcoats,
eyes gray, hunks of ice,

on their necks—not beads,

strings of lice.

They had not managed to wait out the trains,
dead Gentile women in greatcoats

without evenings, without dawns

strewn out by doorsteps.

Gray Russian stations

in a bright winter,

valises, bags, bundles, railway ties,
dead Gentile women in greatcoats.

Without evenings, without dawns
strewn by doorsteps,

had not managed to wait out the trains,
dead Gentile women in greatcoats.

Leonard Wolf

So what if I’ve been circumcised

With rituals, as among the Jews?

Field winds have tanned my middle-sized,
Pale, dreaming feet to darker hues.

Some Jews long for isholnt yet—

We toughs, for smoke, and flame in motion;
Eight years’ embattled meadows, set
Underneath the sky’s blue ocean.

tsholnt: a baked stew of beans or potatoes and meat placed in the oven on Friday
for lunch on the Sabbath, when no fires may be lit.
