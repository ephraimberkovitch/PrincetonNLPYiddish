 

76 Yitskhok Leybush Perets

Three hundred and ten worlds

are for those who guard His Torah.
Tell me that it’s worth it

to lose them for a girl!”

His evil angel sneers

in his other ear:

“When it’s over, repent.

He'll forgive you. Why should you fear?
Reuben sinned,

David and Bathsheba sinned,

yet without stint

He gave them paradise,

because He’s good by nature.

A wretched look, a tear,

fasting on a winter day;

only groan and state your
never-evers,

and He'll believe anything you say.”

Monish listened to his angels
but didn’t ponder long.

She appeared in a window,

he was spellbound by her song.

He had hardly seen and heard her
and he flew to her;

and his fears

he left behind him

with the angel weeping tears.
