640 Gabriel Preil

the beauty of things
cannot be exhausted;

but the voice of the poet
recalls a shadowy sailor
cast up on a desolate shore
far from every certainty.

Eternal Now

My mother’s uncle was physician to the Persian Shah;

before that, or after, he built long bridges in the Caspian sea
region.

A graying photo testifies that he was young in 1888,

in the spring of a good wheat year, in Lithuania, near the Prussian
border.

It’s true that I don’t know precisely when his sister became a bride,
but she bore a daughter that spring

who is now, and has been, for a long, long time,
my mother, a little girl grown old

with summers and winters that come to New York
always, always; but there is no then.

I am neither a forgotten link

nor a pampered heir.

I am the man who trades the moment for words,
drinks tea, bites into an apple, listens to the cantor
behind shutters when the Sabbath passes.

Of course, this is not a document;
there is only one now of bright and dark.
There is no then.
