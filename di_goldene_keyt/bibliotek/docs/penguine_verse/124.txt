Kinds of Luck

Everything is marvelous and beautiful
Inside my well-loved children’s book.
A peasant girl can find a golden shoe
That fits precisely the prince’s foot.

A village peasant, poor, the butt of jokes,
A fool his clever brothers all deplore,
Suddenly, inside my children’s book,
Becomes their overlord.

Again, a poor man, weary, wandering,
Meets a beggar on the road.

The beggar, not exactly what he seems,
Gives the traveler a rich reward.

A youth who means to leave his town
Seeks for something in a wood, and there
He meets a lovely lady riding who
Invites him to her castle fair.

Leonard Wolf

So!

So, they disappear,

The songs of yesteryear.
So they fade away,

The songs that praised
Her golden head, her hair
Of silk, her noble limbs.

Gently fades away

The antique noble song

OF the rustling of her dress.
In a time of dissonance,
Silk chooses not to sing...
Silk, too, is hushed.

Leonard Wolf
