/ forms a moving portrait of
_ the modern J ewish experience

While Yiddish has been spoken for almost one. he choussnd years
modern Yiddish poetry has developed only over the last 150.
years. Yet, as this distinguished collection shows, a remarkably
broad range of works has emerged, written by poets in Eastern
Europe, Russia, and the United States who were attracted to the
freshness of the language, its intimacy and charm, its vivid
mirroring of a folk tradition.

 

Thirty-nine poets are represented here, in pieces that range from
evocations of quiet shtetl life to intense reflections on the
Holocaust. The poems, translated by eminent poets whose
styles match those of their Yiddish counterparts, capture the
spirit of a disappearing culture.

 

“This is the best kind of holocaust memorial, because. __ it resur-
ects the culture that Hitler did his worst to kill. And, given the
Gale) of the poems, this is much more than an act of piety.”
