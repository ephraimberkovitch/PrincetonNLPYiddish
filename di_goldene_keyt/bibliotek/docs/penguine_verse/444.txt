The first minyen was at prayer,
candles and lamps in the windows,
and goodness lay

over the high snow.

Psalms

Countries grow old and fall apart;
nations decline, torn;

generations grow moss and gather dust;
still, every morning,

a chapter of psalms

stands by the window

in the synagogue

and intones its eternal chant

over the world’s tears,

over the Gentiles’ mutterings,
over the Jews’ laments.

Jewish boy, do I have to tell you this?
Didn’t you hear him, only yesterday,
playing his muted fiddle?

In cornices of buildings,

birds in their nests

held back their wings;

I think that the glorious Rilke

passed a synagogue

on a summer morning

in a Germany of the past

and heard a psalm.

That morning he found his song,

fell in love with fallen angels

on the roads, with their beggars’ sacks,

416

minyen (Heb. minyan): a minimum of ten Jews who may form a communal
prayer quorum.
