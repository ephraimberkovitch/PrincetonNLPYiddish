268 Dovid Hofshteyn

Flames and flames
And weighty tears
Embitter the clear light
OF my yearning eyes.

My escape route is hidden
In the decline of evenings,
In the ascent of mornings,
In the gleamings of blood.

When houses stand ablaze
With cries of pain;

When clusters of loathing
Roll through the streets
Who is it that bids me wait?
And who prohibits my hate?

Leonard Wolf

 

 

Procession

We're striding in your front ranks,
marching mankind—

with the cool and with the fervid,
with the proud and the courageous—
step after step!

On his high gibbet, the old god
swings and swings.

Patched with air, the old red flag
still flutters and flutters.

Not one step back!

 

Sticks awakening scatter

buckshot on taut drums,

cymbals buffet brightness into drifting air,
and far into the distance shining trumpets
hurl their blare.
