4 Moyshe Kulbak

Twisted and turned on the oven; he was weak
And enveloped in fear; his nightshirt unbuttoned.

The wind on the meadow stirred up the waves of the Niemen.
The old cow in the barn kept up her incessant complaining.

The uncles, by twos, lay in their beds. They turned their dull
faces

And gazed at the rafters in silence.

My grandfather, twisting and turning, begged his son, ‘“Avram,

My child, won't you give us a sad song?”

Then Avram crawled from his warm bed—

There, in the dark, he was gray as a fir tree—

And sang, like the wind stirring the leaves in the autumn.
Then howled in the dark as a wolf does

At night on the roads; as a wolf might

Howl on a snow-dazzled plain.

Like logs, my uncles lay huddled
As my grandfather beat at the oven
And wept, “O Lord, help us,

Life is dark; life is bitter.”

Through Avram’s strong frame passed a shudder,

And his song gave a spurt, like a mirror;

Like a lake in blue fog it resounded—

And he was as dark as an oak and as sturdy.

He threw his hair back and put himself in position,

Like a stallion that yearns for a hot mare,

(For, in a dream, he had seen the young Gentile, Nastasya).
Then he danced with his hands on his hips and he kindled
A gleam of delight in the eyes of the watchers,

Till the griefs in the hut fled like gray magpies.

Avram danced and he sang and he stamped with his great boots;
His eyes glowed; the air scorched; he was flame; he was fire;
Till my grandfather felt that he and the hut were both flying,
That he was creeping up high on a broken-runged ladder.
