AARON
GLANTS-LEYELES

1889, Wioctawek, Polandâ€”1966, New York.

fter emigrating to London in 1905 and to New York in 1909,

Glants-Leyeles studied literature at Columbia University. A
lifelong activist in socialist and Yiddish cultural causes, he helped
found Yiddish schools in New York, Chicago, and western Canada
and was one of the organizers of the Central Yiddish Cultural
Organization, CYCO, in 1937.

At about the time he began to publish verse in 1914, he also
became a writer and literary critic for the Yiddish daily Der Tog
(The Day). As coeditor of In Zikh (1920), he helped formulate the
Introspective credo that true poetry had to filter through the psy-
chological prism of the self. Rebelling against their literary
predecessors in America, the In Zikh group made no distinction
between the intellectual and emotional content of verse, and
favored modernist fragmentation of selfhood. Champion of free
verse, Glants-Leyeles also experimented with strict verse forms
such as rondeaux and villanelles.
