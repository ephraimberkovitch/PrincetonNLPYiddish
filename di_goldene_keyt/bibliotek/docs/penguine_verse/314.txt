Intimate Melodies

I crept at night out through the moonlit garden

To the green valley where, in the gypsy tents,

Young Dzeyma dealt my cards out, speaking hoarsely
About the past. Hopes, longings that long since

 

Were buried, suddenly rose from secret graves,

And I looked at her with love: the caravan daughter

She seemed; her dark-skinned breasts, her Eastern robes—
Soon, once again, the jacks and queens scatter.

She speaks aloud her prophecies, now wanton,
Now tender: a slim young woman with dark hair.
I fall in love with her; I have divined

A happiness awaits me, drawing near. .

She saw the future: in a lonely corner

I stroked her unto madness, unto pain,

Till, on the white tents scattered there, the morning’s
Earliest light fell cold and alien.

I love your lustful, fainting-weary gaze,
Dzeyma, and your hair’s coal-black waves;
Your vivid tatters, Sidon’s merchandise;
Your dark eye’s desert cave.

So lovely, wildly elegiac, lying

With the long shadow cast beneath your brow;
I dream you: slim and young, a concubine
Brought here from some distant harem now.

Sidon: the Phoenician port city, north of Tyre, from which Jezebel introduced
into Israel the worship of Baal, the Canaanite god, and Astarte, the goddess
of love and war.
