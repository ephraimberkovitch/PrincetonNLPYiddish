ITSIK MANGER
1901, Czernowitz, Rumania—1969, Tel Aviv.

he son of a tailor, Manger was sent to a German high school,

but after being expelled for misconduct, he spent some years
at his father’s trade. A lifelong enfant terrible, he reveled artistical-
ly in the tradition of the Yiddish folk song and the Yiddish theater
of his native region. In the best-known of his works, Medresh It-
sik, he simulates the Jewish tradition of homiletic storytelling to
provide his own poetic interpretations of important biblical per-
sonages and events. From 1928 to 1938 he spent most of his time in
Warsaw, winning fame as a poet, essayist, lecturer, and occasional
dramatist. He moved to Paris and then, after the German occupa-
tion, to London. In 1951 he came to New York, and following
several visits to Israel he settled there in the early 1960s.

The most popular of modern Yiddish poets, thanks to the humor
and accessibility of some of the poems and his obvious affection
for folk sources, he enjoyed the incongruous coupling of tra-
ditional forms, like the ballad, with sophisticated motifs of contem-
porary European poetry. His use of impersonal, anonymous folk
genres for highly expressive personal moods results in an innocent
world weariness, a distinctive mixture of romantic fancy and ironic
mischief.
