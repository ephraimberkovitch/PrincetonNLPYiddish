YITSKHOK
LEYBUSH PERETS

1852(?), Zamos¢, Poland—1915, Warsaw.

T and Sholem Aleichem (Sholem Rabinovitsh), Perets is one of
the three classic masters of modern Yiddish literature. The only
modernist among them, he is best known for his short stories and
dramas, written in Yiddish and Hebrew. He began as a social critic,
exposing the miserable conditions of Jewish life and the psy-
chological accommodation that helped to perpetuate them. By the
turn of the century, as revolutionary movements gathered
strength, emigration to America and elsewhere increased, and
traditional orthodoxy crumbled, Perets turned back to folk
materials and Hasidic stories, though in ways that usually involved
an inner tension between their content and his modern, often
ironic, outlook.

Perets made his literary debut in Yiddish with the ballad
“Monish” in 1888, after he had already achieved some slight
renown as a Hebrew poet. Prolific journalist and editor, he stood at
the center of Polish Jewish literary life like no Yiddish writer before
or since, exerting profound influence on the successive develop-
ments of Yiddish realism, symbolism, and expressionism.
