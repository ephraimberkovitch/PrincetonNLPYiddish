He'll come on a child at play in the sun,
Like a beggar (also a mother’s child)

Not born to be blind, but punished instead.
If, honored in some strange town, he’s led
With a klezmer band to the local bath,

He can rise like a lion, roaring in wrath,
And slam the shutters and shut the door
To make it as dark as it was before.

But for me—for me it would do as much good
As taking my shoes off to walk through a wood
OF thornbushes: even the mouse, it would seem,
Keeps itself hidden because of my gleam.

Even Lilith—no sooner thought of, than she,
Too, turns into light and trails after me

Like a tarted-up wretch who, you can bet—
My God—to collect the smallest debt

Would follow you into the outhouse, yet.
And if I look, like a goy at an axe

At a word as lofty as “Rimzi-Brax”’

Whose light and whose significance

Are as alien to me as a shirt and pants

To a wolf in a cage, that light sticks to me there
As warmly as cow dung does to a bare

Foot. My God.

Even, I feel, if I rave away

Like a feverish woman in labor—what good
Will have occurred

If my jewel, the word,

Always flows out of me, come what may,
Like fire struck from the broken wood

OF a tree hit by lightning in the night?

 

klezmer band: Jewish musicians, usually violins, bass, drum, and clarinet.
Lilith: known in Jewish folklore as the queen of demons, who preys espe-
cially on newborn infants.
