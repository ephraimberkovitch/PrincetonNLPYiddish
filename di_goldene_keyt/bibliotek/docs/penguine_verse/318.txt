I thumb through the thick prayer books’ yellowed leaves
Which she had used to pray from with such power.
They stilled her heart-storms, let her tears relieve

The pain of prayer.

I see so clearly how it longs for her:

The floor, for her slipper; the wall, for her shadow; and
The old abandoned tsene-renes waiting

For her beloved, gaunt, old woman’s hand.

I often watch you leave the morning service
Walking so calmly, thoughtful, motherly,
Chastened with your praying to the Virgin,
A tender child of nobility.

Pious and quiet, you leave the churchyard, holding
Carefully between your pale hands

The prayer book bound in leather, black and golden,
And the black prayer beads with it, a long strand.

Your slender fingers must carry now the scent

Of incense, and your ears, the organ hymn;

Your Catholic blood flows modest with the restraint
Of generations; like church air, your skin

Must be so cool. Silently, you slip by
But I know you see me.

This evening, on your knees
When you pray for your loved ones to the Blessed Mary,
You may pray for me also, with that liquid gaze.

Tsene-rene (Heb. Tsena U-Re’ena: Come and See): the Yiddish collection of

homilies on selected passages of the Pentateuch, the Haftarot, and Megilot,
composed by Jacob ben Isaac Ashkenazi (c. 1600), was the most popular
book among Jewish women.
