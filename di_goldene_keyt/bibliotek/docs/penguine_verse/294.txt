266 Dovid Hofshteyn

To the breathing of multitudes.
And to inflame

With earth’s torches my gleam of desire.
My blade took the gleam

OF glittering swords;

And the sounds of worldly bells
Now resounds

Over fragments

Of my copper bells—

Old copper, and red—and old.
City!

The ship of my loneliness

Is hidden in your harbor.

Leonard Wolf

When clenched teeth grate

When clenched teeth grate,
When eyes sparkle,
Who can measure . . . who can advise me?
Who can ask:
“Have you weighed it?’
I know only one thing.
That's all I can count:
The heart’s
Inflamed;
It drives
The blood.
It glows
With pain
And blooms
With courage
And I can’t divide the courage from pain.

 

Driven in to the circle of houses,
Tamed with steel thorns,

What is there left for me?

My pale face
