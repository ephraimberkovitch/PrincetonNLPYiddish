Though a socialist in his opinions, Reisen wrote in a spirit under-
cutting militancy; his poems and stories turn Yiddish readers in-
ward, to an ironic contemplativeness.

A new world being made—one hears
In childhood that it has begun;
Then comes the passage of the years—
Is it not yet fully done?

John Hollander

Spiritually close to the folk, Reisen was by no means a folk poet.
Intellectually devoted to the Yiddish-speaking workers, he was not
(like, say, Rosenfeld) a worker himself. Reisen was an educated
man with a considerable knowledge of European literature, but he
lived out his life completely within the Yiddish milieu—for him,
that culture was a sufficient world. And he looked upon it with a
blend of irony, affection, and sadness, as if somehow, beneath the
level of explicit knowledge, he had sensed its fragility and tran-
sitoriness, or as if he could foretell later judgments:

Future generations,

Brothers still to come,

Don’t you dare

Be scornful of our songs.

Songs about the weak,

Songs of the exhausted

In a poor generation,

In the world’s decline.
Leonard Wolf

In both his poems and stories, Reisen takes his culture quite for
granted. Precisely for this reason, the writings that his contem-
poraries assumed to be transparent may well come to seem distant,
perhaps even opaque, to readers of the future. When Reisen refers
fleetingly in one of his stories to a cantor’s hoarseness on Yom Kip-
pur, or when he writes with a characteristic mixture of amusement
and sadness his lyric ‘To a Woman Socialist,” he feels no need to
explain or elaborate. He knows that the channels between himself
and his readers are still unblocked; that, at least for a time, they still
share an organic culture.
