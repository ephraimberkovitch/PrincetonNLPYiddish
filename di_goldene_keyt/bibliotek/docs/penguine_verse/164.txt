Strangers

Like a child, down onto her heart he fell there,
Wan-eyed, and in great lonely sorrow nursed
With all of his blood hungrily athirst

On her awakened springs, a golden pair,

Her taste of milk, then moved in like a knife
To open her sweet body up, to stay

Inside, die in cool damp, then fall away

Up in her Deep, back in her stuff of life.

They sat at evening with stars overhead
At table. And they both ate of the bread.
Between them on the table the knife stayed.

Their eyes like strangers’, each other’s eyes evaded,
As though their knot had been cut, and they were divided,
Like two ends of the table, by the blade.

Odors

Such pungent odors the old synagogues dispel:

Like those a cemetery’s cleansing-shed will hold—

The basin, the copper of the pitcher, reek of mold;

Of fine dust and the moth, the ark’s silk curtains smell;

The books, of altars, sacrificial celebrations,

Old candles, and the sweet wine of the word of God;
To this the niches of the candelabra add

The stench of salt from tears of ancient lamentations.

But from the tables caked with dirt there has arisen
A sweet, delicious odor now of something such
That your beard is quite damp, your mouth waters so much—
