AARON ZEITLIN

(Aren Tsytlin) 1899, Uvarovo, Russia—1974,
New York.

 

T Zeitlin began to write in early childhood and published his
first poem at the age of fifteen. In Warsaw between the world wars
he wrote prolifically—poems, narratives, dramas, essays, in both
Yiddish and Hebrew—and served as editor of several important
literary publications, including the Yiddish journal Globus
(1932—34) and the Hebrew periodical Hatekufa. He was invited to
New York by the director Maurice Schwartz, for the production of
his play Esterke, in 1939, and was thereby saved from the fate that
overtook his wife and family. Unlike most Yiddish poets, Zeitlin
continued to draw, thematically and spiritually, from the Jewish
religious and mystical tradition as well as from secular cosmo-
politan artistic sources.
