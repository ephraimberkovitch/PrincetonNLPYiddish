198 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

But J—O thou, my God above all—

I still crave goose fat or jam to spread,
As thick as my finger, on my bread;
The boots I still walk around in show
Up just as red against the snow

As a Jew with a shikse behind a wall.

 

And after all, it doesn’t just leap

Out of my head, that light I dream:

It will even gleam

Out at my navel from behind

Like a child still wet from the womb, and bright,
Or a basket of suns and moons you might find
In an empty meadow somewhere at night.

But even if all I imagined were lit

No more than a basket of comets you might
Count out on a dead man’s shirt, a bit

Too much shining would still be going on:
Thus nobody should ever make fun

Of someone who raises his hands in fright
And flees from me, like a train in flight
From smoke-—its own. My God.

What a game that is!

The faster the train can push smoke out

The faster the smoke can push it about,

The faster smoke pushes the train about

The faster the train will push it out,

And that’s strange. My God!

But that smoke should push the train ahead
While the train pushes smoke behind instead,
Shouldn’t be so. My God.

The prophet out in the world will run

About—it’s true—over field and wild:
With a pair of shining glasses on,

shikse: a term for a Gentile girl.
