My uncle stood still, confused by his singing.

The last bit of torch flickered out in its socket.

Grandpa smiled, rubbed his hands, and said, ‘Avram,
Where'd you get such a voice?’”’ The blue dawn-light
Crept into the hut. The trees in the garden,

Wound round with straw, were still freezing.

The wind in the cart shed plucked wool from a sheepskin;
The old cow in the barn lapsed at last into silence.

Nastasya...

Nastasya was gathering sorrel on the footpaths

To make a meal for her father, Antosha.

Byelorussia is blessed with cold, shaggy sorrel,

With fir trees like pelts, and ravens like cinders.

Bowed, she went through the fields, clutching her apron.

She moved like a duckling that knows neither evil nor sorrow.

Her feet, moistened by dew and tinged by the light of the
morning.

Her hand at her eyes, she watched as he came from a distance
Out of the woods, in his arms a horse-collar.

Her hand at her eyes, she watched as he came from a distance.
His step was so lively—as if he had slept in the forest.

Shyly, Nastasya bent once again to the sorrel,

It was Avram, at dawn, coming back from tending the horses.
“Good morning, Nastasya. Timid, sweet lambkin, good morning!’’
Nastasya, embarrassed, tried hiding herself in the bushes
Hoping that Avram, my sturdy young uncle, might miss her,
But Avram plunged into the thicket at once and his laughter,
Deep in the leaves, could be heard a far distance.

“Lambkin, my sweet one, my darling. Where are you?’
Hidden in leaves, Nastasya was pleased by my uncle.

“He looks so lively, as if he had slept in the forest.”
