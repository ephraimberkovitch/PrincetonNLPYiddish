Christmas, with its religious processions and pageants, inspired fear
among the Jews.

Christmas

The bronze of bells aroused by the night sky,
The town has frost, flares, incense on its breath;
Their God arises joyfully from death

And the crowds carry, on a pole on high,

His image. And their tread, heavy and blind,
Bears hate aloft; on every upper floor
Children of Israel, fearful, count the more
On You, God of mercies, being lovingkind.

While outside doors and shutters sings the snow,
Wide blue heavens dazzle the eye with frost,
The night from crown to girdle is embossed
With stars and quiet—but a shriek below

Rips peace away from its secluded life:
The outcry of blood in terror of their knife.

John Hollander

The Sun Is Good...

The sun is good to everyone. It shines for little
Children in the street; on threshholds for the old;
For travelers afar on the long, wearying road;

For stalks of corn in fields, and for the silent cattle.

It’s good even to arsonists, and good to wolves,

And good to whores who come out with the night so gaily,
For it bestows on night and on its sinners daily

The very world itself, as westward it revolves.
