Indian Summer

 

The bonfire of my Indian summer burns
In drops of gold and into smoke rings, and
Now I scrape the final star of coal,
Wordless and pious, with a darkened hand.

And night and villages. On lunar flutes
Crickets are playing sadness on my soul.
On white grass by the blossoming hedges,
Yellow as the moons, the pumpkins roll.

And trees—blue wax—glow in cool nudity
Like tall candles, or awe-struck before God.
Silence marks sharply the fall of dead leaves;
Sharper the trouble wherein I have trod.

John Hollander

Through the Eye of the Needle

Dear Comfort, when you come today
Don’t lie: I am all clarity,

Thus let my tongue keep dumb in re
The wounding of what's true of me.

Only my poem—a puff of prayer,
A reticent wink of suffering,

A silent lamb unfolded there

I bring, my good Lord’s offering.

And with burning lips, with all

Humps, bones, and hair, with snaggletooth,
I, like the ancient camel, crawl

Through my needle’s eye of truth.

John Hollander
