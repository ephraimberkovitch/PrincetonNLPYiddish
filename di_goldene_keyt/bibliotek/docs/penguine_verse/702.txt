674 Abraham Sutzkever

Everything’s gone.
You are not here.
Only a poem remains.
A foolish cry.

A not knowing why.

1935 Chana Bloch

In the Sack of the Wind

A barefoot vagabond on a stone
in evening's gold

shakes off

the dust of the world.

Suddenly, from out of the woods
a bird flies
and snatches up the last grain of sun.

There’s also a willow near the river.

A road.

A field.

A fresh meadow.

Footprints of clouds, foraging in secret.
Where are the hands that make miracles?

There’s also a live fiddle.

What is there to do at such a moment,
O my world of a thousand colors,

but to gather up that beautiful redness
in the sack of the wind

and bring it home for supper.

And then there’s loneliness, like a mountain.
1935 Chana Bloch
