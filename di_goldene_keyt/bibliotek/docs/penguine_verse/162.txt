Fed by him from the root up to the face
With overflowing, as if given suck ...

He doomed you to become a pile of muck,
For death and the blind worm a nesting place.

His Will your wisdom cannot comprehend:

You only know you've been vouchsafed to see
His light, the purple of his drapery.

Thus when that light leaves your eye at the end

Throw your head down at his anointed sole:
Give thanks, till earth has covered your mouth whole.

A Plum

In the cool evening, the good provider plucked
From off a tree a fully ripened plum,

Still with its leaf on, and bit into some

Of its dewy, blue skin. From there, unlocked,

The long-slumbering juice came leaping up,
Foaming and cool. In order to make use
Of every single drop of all that juice,
Slowly, as one walks bearing a full cup

Of wine, he brought a double handful of plum
To his wife, and gently raised it to her mouth,
Whereupon she could lovingly begin—

“Thanks,” she said—to gnaw the plum from out
Of his hands, until those hands held only skin,
And pit, and flecks of overbrimming foam.
