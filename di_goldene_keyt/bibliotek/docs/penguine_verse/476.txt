 

448 Jacob Glatstein

With these words, I meant to give the entire creation
A hell of a poke in the ribs.

But all at once,

An old tree breaks into sobs

Enough to give me heartache.

And things begin to move.

With all its secret force,

The whole wood undertook to be

Itself in the dawn.

The trees turned their faces toward me,
The birds broke into twitters,

The hare gave me a smile,

The water in the brook said sincerely,
“Nakhman, give me your blessing,”
And the flowers burst into bloom

As if in the Garden of Eden.

A crow laughed aloud, like a child,
And all petulance was gorie.

I breathed an air like wine.

And everything quickened the soul; all was alive
And there was a burst of joyful noises:
“Who is delusion,

Who doesn’t exist?

We are here, here, here.’’

And thus, an angry world

Dawned into radiance and light,

And there was squealing,

And whistling, and yelling as loud as might be:
“We are here, here, here,

We are here, here, here.”

Until I, too, myself

Stood in the midst of the wood

And my voice rang out like a shoyfer:

“World, I swear by this morning hour,
World, you are here.”

shoyfer: ram’s horn blown on High Holidays.
