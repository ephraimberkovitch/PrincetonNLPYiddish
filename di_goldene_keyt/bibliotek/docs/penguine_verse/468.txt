Rabbi Nakhman of Bratslav (1772-1810), great-grandson of the founder
of the Hasidic movement, Rabbi Israel Baal Sher Tov, was the founder of
his own Hasidic sect that survives to this day. His scribe, Nathan of
Nemirov, served as Rabbi Nakhman’s secretary and, after the latter’s
death, published his teachings. The characteristic form of expression
favored by Rabbi Nakhman was the oral tale, often embodying complex
symbolic elements and implications. Many modern Yiddish writers have
considered Rabbi Nakhman their spiritual ancestor.
The segments below are part of a longer dramatic monologue.

The Bratslaver to His Scribe

1

Nathan, lay off thinking today;

Have you ever seen such a world:

Such loveliness, every which way?

lll give you a mouthful of fist

If you squeeze out a thought today.

Is there anything that keeps you from living?
Live, with all of your organs;

Breathe the sun, like a fly... .

Let’s go backward again . .

Let’s think our whole fortune away

And squander our thoughts on the byways.
Let’s become holy peasants

With hallowed cows on a holy pasture;
Let’s eat kasha with milk;

Let’s find stinking tobacco to smoke

And tell fairy tales about dwarfs;

And let’s sing songs.

Dai-donna-dai, dai-donna-dai,
Pure songs, without words—
Dai-donna-dai.

I see a small cloud rising already
over your forehead.
Oh, what a sock in the kisser I’ll give you
