Leyzer Volf

Winter sheds its silent cotton wool,
summer puts on its fripperies of green,
and fall expires, a yellow cockerel.

Raw though I am with wounds, I’m waiting still,
each Sabbath eating hen-fat with my bread,
and swallowing—my daily bitter pill.

I have for husband my Turkish sewing machine,
I have for sons and daughters yards of cloth,
I have for grandsons needles sharp and thin,

for mother-in-law a tabby, for father-in-law a tom,
and for my son-in-law a mole as blind can be
that has already dug a pitch-black hole for me.

1928 Robert Friend

I Am Not a Honey-Hearted Child

And I have never been mild.

My heart is always wild,

In sorrow and in joy.

Raging like a tiger in a crate of straw,
raging like a black sea to the shore,

when days are sunnily singing and rejoice.

I have always succumbed to sin.

I have never been

a honey-hearted child,

but like a stubborn horse no one can tame,

I’ve always broken loose from bridle and from stall.
And only bathed in the wildest waterfall.

And I have always yearned for glory and for fame.
May I be deaf and dumb, may I be blind
if the cosmos will not do the bidding of my mind,
