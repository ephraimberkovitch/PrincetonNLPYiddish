352 Perets Markish

My mother’s sewing me a shirt

Of the sky’s bright linen—

And my blind destiny expects a train

In lonely train stations.

Such widespread woe lies on your bosom,
Great land of horror.

Who cares that a neck is already
Stretched on the rails.

On Sunday, there'll be a carousel

And sorrow, also, dancing.

1921 Leonard Wolf

Markish’s agonized response to the Ukrainian pogroms of 1919—20, this
work is a kind of “Black Kaddish” dedicated to the victims of the pogrom
in Gorodishche. It can be read as a parody of the prayers on the Day of
Atonement, as indicated by the date of 11 Tishrei, the day after Yom Kip-
pur. These excerpts constitute about two fifths of the poem, which was
first published in Warsaw in 1921 and in a slightly different version in
Kiev in 1922.

From The Mound

After you, the killed of the Ukraine;
After you, butchered
In a mound in Gorodishche,

The Dnieper town...
Kaddish

No! Heavenly tallow, don’t lick my gummy beards.
Out of my mouth’s brown streams of pitch

Sob a brown leaven of blood and sawdust.

No. Don’t touch the vomit on the earth’s black thigh.

Away. I stink. Frogs crawl on me.
Looking for mother-father here? Seeking a friend?
