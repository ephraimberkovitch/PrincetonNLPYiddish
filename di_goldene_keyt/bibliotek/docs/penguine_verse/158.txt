 

Mani Leyb

With songs in my breast, the Muse in my heart,
I went among poets, a poet to be.

When I came, then, among their company,
Newly fledged from out my shell,

They lauded and they laureled me,
Making me one of their number as well.

O Poets, inspired and pale, and free
As all the winged singers of the air,
We sang of beauties wild to see
Like happy beggars at a fair.

We sang, and the echoing world resounded.

From pole to pole chained hearts were hurled,

While we gagged on hunger, our sick chests pounded:
More than one of us left this world.

And God, who feedeth even the worm—
Was not quite lavish with his grace,

So I crept back, threadbare and infirm,
To sweat for bread at my working place.

But blessed be, Muse, for your bounties still,
Though your granaries will yield no bread—
At my bench, with a pure and lasting will,
I'll serve you solely until 1 am dead.

In Brownsville, Yehupets, beyond them, even,
My name shall ever be known, O Muse.

And I’m not a cobbler who writes, thank heaven,
But a poet who makes shoes.

John Hollander
