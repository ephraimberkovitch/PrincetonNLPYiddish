YISROEL RABON

(Rubin) 1900, a village near Radom, Polandâ€”1941,
Ponary, near Vilna.

R began to publish satiric verses on topical subjects at the age of
fifteen. He wrote stories and poems, expressing a naturalistic and
often grotesque view of the trapped individual. His several collec-
tions of poetry, including Behind the Fence of the World (1928)
and Gray Spring (1933), and his novels, The Street (1928) and
Balut (1934), portray in grotesque form the estrangement of the
uprooted city dweller in Poland during the years between the wars.

Rabon lived mostly in Lodz and briefly in Warsaw. After the
German occupation he escaped to Bialystok and Vilna, where he
was killed in one of the mass slaughters.
