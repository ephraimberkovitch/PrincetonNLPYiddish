600 Aba Shtoltsenberg

A bad winter,

typhus among gentiles,

crosses sprout in their graveyard.

The gentile walks, stooped.

Priests trudge through snow with the host,
and gentile women with candles.

Pelakhâ€™s eyes flare through sick villages.

At Passover: beggars.

Clouted feet, hooded head.

Sprawl in ditch, or on church steps,

squat for weeks, get no alms.

Cellar doors are forced.

Clothes die in their closet.

Stilt-high Germans strut.

From sleds, through night, inhuman song carries.

Young Ukrainians

They unfold like a snake

and crawl on their belly.

Miles around haystacks flare,
homesteads go up in smoke.
Bloodied, and striking matches, they
crawl along the flat of the land,
down culverts and over Polish roads,
soaked and lice-eaten.

In the capital, aristocrats

set a price on their head.

Pelakh: a haunting creature of Ukrainian folklore.
