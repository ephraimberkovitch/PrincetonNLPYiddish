The Coarse Old Maid

Exactly as if it were in a shed or pen
I live—a moldy-green and coarse old maid,
a crusty bit of soldier’s bread, baked God knows when.

I sit at my yellow Turkish machine—and thread,
sew, stitch and unstitch, from the first crack of dawn
till evening bleeds upon my spindle; then,

beside a black and suffocating wick
I gulp my cabbage, red beets, and dry bread,
and take a dose of salts to wash them down.

My red day crawls, a crab, toward set of sun.
My Friday candle’s yellow as my cheek.
My Sabbath is a sack, empty and grayish-brown.

A raven that falls on its prey, I fall on my bed,
with a white-as-radish and embittered head,
shedding, like broad beans, my brown-as-liver tears.

O come, dear truelove of good family,
silken- and flaxen-haired, and by my side
all black and blue, O lie down lovingly.

I have been stitching, stitching all my life,
taking embroidery needles to my flesh.
O my dear God, when shall I be a wife?

My Turkish-fashioned beau, so young, so fresh,
come, come to me. I have one male alone,
the cock that crows before my door each dawn.

I have for dowry, I would have you know,
forty green notes and a ram-skin counterpane.
Husband! I’ve waited thirty years or so!
