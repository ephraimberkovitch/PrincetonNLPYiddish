444 Jacob Glatstein

I'll break your leg

If you don’t understand the refrain

Or change it by adding a word, or so much as a letter.
It will have to be simple—like this:

Dai-donna-dai.

There are some kinds of people

Who think for a year and a day

And their heads become holy.

But they consider the body entire as dust made of dust.
They look into a holy book

And roll their eyes upward,

But they treat their lovely limbs

As if they were dust and ashes.

And everything over the belt

And under the cincture

Is unclean and then uncleaner.

They teach themselves verbal graces,

And are pilgrims to holy places,

But let a hungry man come begging a handout

And their hands close tight

And their hearts close tighter.

They've exiled their heads away from all reason

And their brains are dizzied, spinning with heavenly spheres
While the dear bit of humanity is lost

For all eternity.

 

 

Now, therefore, Nathan, I tell you

That thought is as words are to music,
And music lives in the heart.

See that the heart thinks truly

And the head, of itself, will stop spinning.
I detest that holy man—

That would-be expert

Who spoils with imprisoning wisdom

belt: Hasidim customarily wore belts to distinguish the upper, spiritual part
of the body from its lower, animalistic region.
