410  Moyshe Kulbak

Dung and rigid walls are steeping in their damp.

It may happen by night that a breeze blows stone and rooftop dry,
And a vision, moonbeam and drops of water,

Flows through the silver, tremulously dreaming streets.

It is the Viliya, cool, mistily arising,

Fresh and baby-naked, with long, riverlike hands,

That has come into the town. Blind windows are grimacing.
Arching bridges are crooked on their walls.

No door will open. No head will move

To meet the Viliya in her skinny, blue nakedness.

The bearded walls marvel—the hills around you.

And silence. Silence.

You are a dark amulet set in Lithuania.

Figures smolder faintly in the restless stone.

Lucid white sages of a distant radiance,

Small, hard bones that were polished by toil.

The red tunic of the steely bundist.

The blue student who listens to gray Bergelson—

Yiddish is the homely crown of the oak leaf

Over the gates, sacred and profane, into the city.

Gray Yiddish is the light that twinkles in the window.
Like a wayfarer who breaks his journey beside an old well,
I sit and listen to the rough voice of Yiddish.

Is that the reason why my blood is so turbulent?

I am the city: the thousand narrow doors into the universe,
Roof over roof, to the muddy-cold blue.

I am the black flame, hungry, licking at these walls—
That glows in the eyes of the Litvak in an alien land.

I am the grayness! I] am the black flame! I am the city!

And, on the old synagogue, a frozen water carrier,
Small beard tilted, stands counting the stars.
