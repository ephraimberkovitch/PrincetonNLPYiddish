ANNA MARGOLIN

(Rosa Lebensbaum) 1887, Brest-Litousk, White
Russia—1952, New York.

efore settling permanently in New York in 1914, Margolin

lived for short periods of time in Odessa, Warsaw, New York,
London, Paris, and Palestine and led a stormy private life. In
America she became well known as a journalist and woman’s
columnist. She published her first poems (as Anna Margolin) in
1920, soon after her marriage to the Yiddish poet Reuven Ayzland.
Her tightly controlled verse, worldly in tone and allusions, bore
some similarities to the work of the Imagists.
