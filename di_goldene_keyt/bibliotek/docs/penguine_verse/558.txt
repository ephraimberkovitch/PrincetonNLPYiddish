August

August. I’ve come to the shtetl on a cool
Transparent evening. The dusk is blue.
A smiling poignancy ascends like smoke.
At dawn, the shtetl rises in a dew.

The air is clear and warm, down from the heights
A luscious apple fragrance drifts.

The summer haze is airy, light,

And the heart turns dense and luscious, too.

Not long ago I cursed and railed at you,
And now, you lie before me, hushed.

I wander in a fume of fruit and blossom
And August lies transparent here, and cool.

August 1925 Leonard Wolf

Pass On, You Lonely Grandfathers. . .

Pass on, pass on, you lonely grandfathers,
With frightened beards covered with snow,
In the last sorrow, in the final grief
You're still here, the final witnesses.
Pass on, pass on, you lonely grandfathers!

Then woe and grief to your entire shtetl,
Trampled down with pain and poverty,

It’s been so long you’ve had to smile and beg
For every famished morsel of your bread.
Then woe and grief to your entire shtetl.

Tired and fearful, do you look about you

And feel a frightened trembling in your knees?
Who knows, who knows whether these sons
Will still survive, these sons, as Jews?

There is a frightened trembling in your knees.
