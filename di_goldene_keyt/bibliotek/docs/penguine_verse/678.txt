650 Yankev Fridman

Diamond star-beads sparkle on the girls’ bare breasts.

It seems to me that the beads smell like red berries under
white snow.

And when I lick the sled with my tongue, I taste them both,

the beads and the breasts of the seven enchanted brides,

on the frozen river among the marble cliffs.

God no longer speaks

God no longer speaks

as he did in the days of the Bible,

he no longer shines in the firecloud

over our roof.

Adam and Eve have run into the depths of the garden
from God’s unveiled presence,

as we—we run, seeking him

in the darkness of a closed bud... .

The barefoot steps of angels

no longer kiss our threshold

as in the days of our forefathers.
But our yearning weeps

for their blue wings

that swim like drowned moons
over all the world’s rivers. .

At midnight we huddle, pressing our ears to the sleeping grass,
to the leaf of a tree, to the skin of young fruit:

looking for God’s fragrant silence, trying to translate it

with the shadow words of ancient song.

Our forefathers could hear God’s words,
but we write hidden poems

to hide our naked longing for God’s breath,
more silent than the breath of stars

over sleeping wintertime lakes.
