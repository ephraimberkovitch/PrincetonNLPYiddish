4 Perets Markish

They’re here. They're here, but taint the air with stink.
Away. Awkwardly they delouse themselves with hands like
warped brass.

From top to bottom, a mound of filthy wash.

Claw, crazed wind. Take what you want; take it.

Before you, the church sits like a polecat beside a heap of
strangled fowl.

Ah, black thigh. Ah, blazing blood. Out, shirttails! To the
dance; to the dance.

We're laid out here. All. All. A mound. The whole town.
1 Tishrei 5681

As one of the dead, I'll enter
The day of blood and honey.
My first doves will be

Dead spies upon the land.
Doves. Doves. Uphill.

It is my fate that hangs
Upon the bloody moon,

Her gleams, mere vowel signs.
Bellies, bellies to the dust—
Sleep is for dawn.

A mad town expires on my heart.
Street corners creep from my shoulders.

11 Tishrei 5681: The day after Yom Kippur, corresponds to September 23, 1920.

The day of blood and honey: Alludes to the Book of Joshua’s description of
the return of the Israelites to the land of milk and honey, the spies that were
sent to reconnoiter Canaan, and the second circumcision the Jews underwent
that Passover—to sanctify them for their conquest of the promised land. A
chain of associations leads from this triumphal portion of the Bible to the
song that concludes the Passover service, Khad Gadyo, the only kid, bought
by the father for two coins, and eaten by a cat, touching off a seven-tiered
chain of retribution. Jewish commentators saw in this kid an allegorical
teference to the oppressed Jewish people, which was bought by the Father
(God) for two coins (Moses and Aaron), then swallowed by Assyria, beaten
by Persia, etc. Images of humiliation lead finally to Samson, blinded and
enslaved.
