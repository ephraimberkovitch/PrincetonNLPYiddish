 

Jacob Glatstein

What could be less?

I am the hearty patron

Of all the hungry tasters.

Let us saddle sleep

And ride off in our private park.
The mays will kiss

The must-nots in the dark.

Chana Bloch

Wagons

With quiet signs of faraway

At dusk the mournful wagons come.

Doors stand ajar,

But no one waits to meet them.

The town is peaceful, bells of silence toll.
Every blade of grass pricks up

In the heady cool.

A few sickly Jews climb down from the wagons,
And a clever word falters

In every brooding head.

God, on your scale of good and bad,

Set a dish of warm porridge,

Toss some oats, at least, for the skinny mules.
The deadness of the town grows dark.

A cruel silence afflicts the Jewish beards,
And each sees in the otherâ€™s eyes

A prayer of fear:

When death comes,

Let me not remain the only one,

Do not pass over me with my thin bones.

June 1938 Chana Bloch
