 

Leyb Kvitko

Into my gloom of distant days,
Breath by breath exhaled

With all my many-thousand souls,
On the ashes of the road,

On the ashes of being. . . .

Esau,

On the broad canvas of pain, of moldy distant days,
Is spun,

Is sewn,

Is stitched,

My ancient heart.

My ancient dreams

My dark glassy stare... .

Look there, look there. .

Esau,

Leave me and tend your sheep,
Your fragrant springs,

Lay your hand on them,

Your hairy ancient hand... .

Allen Mandelbaum and Harold Rabinowitz

Russian Death

A Russian death

Is death of all deaths.
Russian pain,

Pain of all pains.

Does the worldâ€™s wound ooze pus?
How does its heart do now?

Ask any child,

Ask any Jewish child.

Allen Mandelbaum and
Harold Rabinowitz
