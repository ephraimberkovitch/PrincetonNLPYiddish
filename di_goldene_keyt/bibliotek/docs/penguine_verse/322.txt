Inscrutable Cat

Inscrutable cat!

I am as still, as still as you,

Although you tread with shadow-steps—
The peace of distant worlds within your gaze
So softly in the shadows of my rage. .

I am as still, as still as you... .

Along my meager island shore—

The island of my memory—where ruins flicker faintly through
Awareness with its waves, its fog,

On that pathetic island

At times there creeps an ancient frog.

Lazily he looks about, lazily he croaks—

At all that was, the old, the shriveled heretofore.

Then lazily he turns around; he croaks another croak—
At the insane, the stolen here and now.

In me the present and the past are soon to speak no more.
Only the croaking will be etched into my island shore.

I start to sink into a shapeless torpor

And—

I am as still, as still as you. .

Day and Night

Day and night—

Shivering, we wait in bitter day
For moonlit night,

For the caressing moon.

Quivering, we wait in angry night—
For the sunlit day,
For the warming sun.

Day and night—
We must loom large within their eyes,
They bother with us so.
