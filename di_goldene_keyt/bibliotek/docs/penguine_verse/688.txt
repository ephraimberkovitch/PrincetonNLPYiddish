Judd Teller

looking for buyers of cloth,
of a glass of kvass.

We’re related also to those

whose Temple was burned,

but our little synagogue was a dump

that was set afire

by a drunken peasant.

And when the nobleman got wind of it in Warsaw,
he, who wastes the money

meant for peasants’ boots,

didn’t take it to heart.

We climb ladders

with nails in our teeth,

and patch broken rungs.

The sun is low, warming beards,
shingle roofs, and copper pendulums
in dark halls of noblemen.

Our daughters scatter sand,

tie ribbons in their hair,

and, again, wait for matches.

A few weeks more
and scars will heal.
Once it was the brute
who wore the stigma;
today, Abel.

Someone’s wounds will keep oozing.
The widow’s daughter

will scrub her hands

at the glimpse of a man.

And Yankl, the wheelright, will never
forgive the cowardice of his oak hands.
After all, every city has its madmen.
