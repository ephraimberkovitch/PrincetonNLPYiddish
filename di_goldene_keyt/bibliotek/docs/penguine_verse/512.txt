484 Uri Tsvi Greenberg

These excerpts are from the beginning and the conclusion of the poem,
first published in the magazine Albatross, in Berlin in 1923. The alleged
anti-Christian sentiment of one of Greenberg's poems in the magazine's
first issue had provoked its seizure in Poland. Greenberg went to Berlin,
and put out the second and final issue there. As a kind of gloss to the
poem he wrote an impassioned attack on the anti-Semitism that was
threatening Polish Jewry and on the various Jewish organizations that
refused to respond, either through flight or concerted self-defense. “The
horror spreads across all the East Slavic land. | watch it terrorized.”

From In the Kingdom of the Cross

The forest’s black and dense; it grows out of the flatlands. 1
Such depths of grief, such terror out of Europe.

Dark and wild, dark and wild, the trees have heads of sorrow;
From their branches hang the bloody dead—still wounded.

All the faces of the heavenly dead are silver,

And the oil that moons pour out on minds is golden;

And if a voice shouts, ‘Pain!’ the sound’s a stone in water
And the sound of bodies praying—tears falling in a chasm.

 

I am the owl of that sad wood, the accusing-bird of Europe.

In the valleys of grief and fear, in blind midnights under crosses,

I want to raise a brother’s plea to the Arab folk of Asia:

Poor though we may be, come lead us to the desert.

But my sheep are fearful, for the half moon is descending

Like a scythe against our throats.

So I, heart-of-the-world, complain at random. Oh, terror, and oh,
Europe!

In the land of grief, its throats outstretched, the lamb lies,

And I, wound-of-the-world, in Europe, spit blood upon the
crosses—

(In the land of grief old men tremble, and the young whose heads
are made of water.)

In the abyss, beneath the trees, two thousand years of burning
silence,
The sort of poison the abyss accumulates.
