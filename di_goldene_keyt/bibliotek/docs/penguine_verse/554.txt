Last Night I Felt a Poem on My Lips

Last night I felt a poem on my lips,

a luscious fruit, sweet and tart,

but it dissolved into my blood at dawn,
all but its smell and color gone.

I hear the quiet pulsebeat in the stammering of things
that might have come into the open,

abandoned, their heart shut tight,

and no pleading now will lure them out.

Every part of me has died an early death,

my head is bowed in mourning to the ground.
God called me to renew Creation

and I failed to hear His word.

The day paled at the start,

Godâ€™s face is covered with a cloud.

Left with a barren sheet of paper in my hand,
I stand shamed at my door

like a stranger.
