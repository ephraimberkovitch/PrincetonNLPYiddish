 

488 Uri Tsvi Greenberg

There is such a people of naked bodies, bronzed youth under sun-
brands.

(There is no bell there that hangs over heads. Only the planets.)

When one of those bronze young men opens his mouth in the
spacious desert

And glows with love (at the time when the planets appear) and
shouts his love to the planets,

There’s an answering gush of blue-bloody water there at the seam
of the desert:

LOVE.

Shabtai Tsvi (Shabbetai Zevi, 1626—76) was the leader of the strongest
messianic movement in Jewish history. He is traditionally considered a
“false,” even treacherous, messiah because of his conversion to Islam in
1666. In the 1920s Greenberg became interested in the whole gallery of
Jewish messianic figures and rehabilitated them from a modern national
perspective as great, misunderstood visionaries. These excerpts are froma
long poem that appeared in installments in the newspaper Di Velt in War-
saw in 1933, under the pseudonym Yoysef Molkho.

King Shabtai Tsvi

... Shabtai Tévi lived, in fact, by the grace of the Turkish Sultan
—a Moslem like all his courtiers,

and fell (as was the custom) face down on a divan each day, to bow
and pray toward Mecca—

upon his head not David’s gold crown but a Turkish fez with a
tassel—

false Messiah!

cursed by the pious among the Jews, derided by even the foolish.

But it was not sanctity, it was this mockery, that Shabtai Tsvi
desired.
