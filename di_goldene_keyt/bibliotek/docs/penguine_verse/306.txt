and like a bud his face is opening—
everything at last is clear:

“O mother Mercy, how you raise up the sick!
And Wisdom, your sweetness fills my heart!
But better than mercy and wisdom is power—
to send it all to hell with a kick.”

The conclusion of this poem turns on the Jewish custom of not counting
human beings, especially when there is reason to celebrate their number
—lest it provoke the mischievous envy of the evil forces.

The Strikover Rabbi's Wife

Grandma strides around beaming,

charming dimples play over her face.

The table sparkles with porcelain and silver,
in the heavy candlesticks thick candles burn.

Things are being readied for the first Seder.

We children have been here for hours at the table;
our eyes shining, we rock our feet,

and beneath us the long bench squeaks.

Grandma comes out in satin and pearls
looking like a bashful bride:

today for the first time her children

and grandchildren have gathered in the house.

She looks at us and kneads her hands without stop,

and hardly knows what to do with herself for happiness,
and suddenly she runs from the room

and comes right back carrying something in her dress.
