308 Melech Ravitch

a last wagonload of wood,
and a cold farewell.

As it had for eighteen years

the whip cracked, and they trod
the forest path hauling wood
for the winter days ahead.

And when they came from the forest,

no need for them to eat;

they took their own flesh to the slaughter
on their own weary feet.

Two brother horses trembled
when they saw where they stood,
two long heads pressed together,
attentive to the blood.

Plain to see when the yoke was lifted
off their necks that day,
the black skin

where their manes were worn away.

Plain to hear the sound of fear

when they lay in their blood on the floor,
the wild sound of iron hooves

pounding the stony floor

like the sound of their feet on the stony street
for eighteen years,

and their heavy breath as they wentâ€”

two horses

on this lonely earth.

And now their lives are spent.
