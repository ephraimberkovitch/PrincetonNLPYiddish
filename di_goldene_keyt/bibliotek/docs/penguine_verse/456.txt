Evening Bread

On the table: fresh bread, swollen, fat.
Around the table: silent guests—

I, and she, and that other she.

Mute mouths. Drumming hearts.

The guests’ hearts tick like small gold watches.
Close by the bread the knife

is sharp and still,

stiller by far than the guests;

the knife’s little heart has a restless throb
more restless

than mine, or hers, or that 0106 9.

The door’s wide to the dying sun.
On the ceiling

day-weary flies doze.

The windowpanes flash

waiting in dread

dumbstruck by dread

of evening bread.

The knife and I tensely embrace

exchanging terror face to Face.

I brandish the bread

in a quivering grip

and meditate

on my hot love

and deadly hate.

The knife grows weak in the clamp of my fist:
danger and dread

of evening bread.

She takes the knife and looks

at me and at her:

two guests at table, mute, dead.

The blade’s edge sings in her heart,
the dangerous song of evening bread.
