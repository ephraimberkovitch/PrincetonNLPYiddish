196 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

Since this is almost all I want today,

A broomstick now is all I might invoke

(To measure the snow), a bagel made of smoke,
A feather for my cap perched high up there,
And a minute—perhaps two—free as air

In which I might sit myself down, you know,
And sing a song of something in the snow.
But since I know that nobody on earth

Is bound to live in anything but dearth

Of what he wants, it’s what I have I prize.
Really, too—as if guarding my very eyes—

I take great pains now, as along I go,

Not to lose anything (Horrors!) in the snow.

John Hollander

The dichotomy set up in this poem between the prophet and the poet
seems to grow out of vigorous contemporary debates about the proper
function of art. But here the poet lets his imagination run loose.

Light—My Word

Who am I? Who am I? Who could have guessed right
That all I imagine would turn into light?

Like a monkey, from head to foot all hairs,
The prophet’s around for thousands of years
Urging all to acquire his light—free, no cash—
Like a luminous herring you’d find in the trash.

A herring like that you don’t skin: instead,
You hold it aloft, and eat up from the head,
And the famished soul who gets to the tail
At the top, which he also devours, won’t fail
To open his mouth—that crater—so wide
With his hands outspread

As if wanting to cram some more inside.
