Poems from a Diary
1974

Who will last? And what? The wind will stay,

and the blind man’s blindness when he’s gone away,
and a thread of foam—a sign of the sea—

and a bit of cloud snarled in a tree.

Who will last? And what? A word as green
as Genesis, making grasses grow.

And what the prideful rose might mean,
Seven of those grasses know.

Of all that northflung starry stuff,

the star descended in the tear will last.

In its jar, a drop of wine stands fast.

Who lasts? God abides—isn’t that enough?

Cynthia Ozick

In Jewish folklore the sight of a water carrier bearing one or two full pails
is an omen of good fortune; empty pails foretell bad fortune.
1975

The funeral’s early, the concert is late.
I go to both (such is my fate),

A yoke’s round my neck, with two brimming pails.
One’s for good luck, the other one fails.

If one pail hangs empty, you can guess that the other
will never attempt to outdo its own brother.

When the salt’s lost its savor, will it pay through the nose
for seven salt shakers, set out in nice rows?

And the light! Would it wrinkle and burst
if a shade didn’t trouble to water its thirst?
