 

Jacob Glatstein

And it’s joy, after all, and melody also,

And akin to the holy flame,

And his light and hers, becoming united.

Poor Nathan, you're tired; your eyelids are closing.
You're falling asleep.

Don’t leave me here with my thoughts, alone.
Watch with me. Stay.

Nathan,
Inscribe.

Leonard Wolf

Old Age

In old age affection thins.
You move unsure

of your limbs

as of the ground,
calculating how keen

the spurs,

feeling the prick

of every given day.

A pity you missed

all those sunsets.

Flowers, trees, grass

stab you with thorn-song.
You tread your life

as if stepping on glass.
Shadows show shafts

of meaning. Like a gift
you acquire a cool smile.
You grow stingy

with God’s plenitude of time.

Cynthia Ozick
