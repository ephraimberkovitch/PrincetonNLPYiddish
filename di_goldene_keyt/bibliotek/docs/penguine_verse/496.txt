468 Jacob Glatstein

Bit by bit, the daze and maze of it

made me numb.

I dropped and slept. In a dream

a silver horn called, with no one blowing.
Instantly my father took off his everyday clothing.
Over him, like a silken morning gown,

Sabbath fell.

Far away he sat, under a glowing sun,
out of reach. The Sabbath was long
as Lublin. The sun would not set !
till my father gave a sign,
in song.

Then it went down.

Prayer

The inmost sense

of my sublimest words

turns my prayer imbecile.
Exalting You makes incense fill
the air with redolence

of idols.

I pray from a tongue-tied page,
my woebegone God.

 

The least little flower
rejoices You more
than all six days

of Creation.

Evil's inertia

brings You small care.
You lend us years

Lublin: Glatsteinâ€™s birthplace, a city in southeastern Poland with a once large
Jewish population where the poet lived till 1914.
