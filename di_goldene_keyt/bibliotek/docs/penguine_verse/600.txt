572 Itsik Manger

Your brothers need to sell you
To strangers once again.

When they throw you in the pit,
Weep, but not for long.

It’s not the first time that you act
This play out, my dear son.

But when you pass your mother’s grave
That stands beside the way,

Be sure you shed a real tear

And softly, gently say

That gladly would old Jacob serve
Another seventh year
If once before his death he might
Again caress her hair.

By now, you know the rest by heart—
Your exits, cues, and bows.

Again in Pharaoh’s dream there graze
His seven fattened cows.

Interpret for him without fault

As truly as before,

And, don’t forget, in Heaven’s name,
To send me a sack of flour.

And, don’t forget, in Heaven’s name,

Be virtuous, my dear . .

Watch out for the wiles of Pharaoh’s wife
For she is young and fair.”

“Hey, now, my sons. Why do you stand
Without a word to say?”

“Because, Father Jacob, you yourself
Have spoiled the Purim play.”
