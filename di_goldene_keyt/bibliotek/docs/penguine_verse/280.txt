He does not need to need to be.
He and the woman and fear and delight are one;
And he is terribly alone.

Leonard Wolf

Disorder

Fabius Lind has forgotten his name.

He is a clown at the fairs,

Plays tricks before men

Who shave at most once a week;

Before women who wear heavy, worn-out shoes;
And before blacks.

He’s a success.

A hundred housewives—blacks and others—gather around,
Shaking their hips at him,

Crying, “Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,

Our Lord, our Lord! Be our Lord.”

He takes some ten of them to be his wives,
Saying,

You, cook my favorite food with savory!
You, make sure my pajamas have all of their buttons.

You, watch over my sleep, for I fondle my sleep
As a child does the warmth of its mother.

You three, display your large, sad eyes

With all the pain of flogged Africa

So that the most faceted words

On the most delicate tongues will shame me;
So that I never tire

Of cursing the world’s achievements.

You three learn the skills of body-and-love caresses.
Sate the Neanderthal, the Cro-Magnon,
And the rest of the blood drops in me.
