hair groomed

and shining with shampoo,
looks up and sweetly smiles:
Thank you.

The Cat Merchant

I’m on my way to Leutamirsk, the train is leaving soon,.
and only the Devil knows just why I’m going there.
It’s ugly and it’s muddy, but I’ve nothing else to do,
So I’m going to the marketplace and hope to find a fair.

No sooner will I get to town when some fellow, I suppose,

will clap me on the shoulder (we are ringed around by brats)

and ask me what I’ve come to buy—barley, perhaps, or groats?

“What barley, what groats, my friend?” I say. “I’ve come to buy
some cats.”

The marketplace is growing wild: a man has come from Lodz
who’s buying up all the cats (they say) in the vicinity.

Hold on (they say)—it won’t take long before they round them up
and bring all the cats they’ve caught to the marketplace for me.

From cellar and from bathhouse, from alley and from yard,

in baskets and in wheat sacks, and some led on a string,

from shop and roof and basement, and from the house of prayer—
see the black cats, the white cats, the brown cats they bring;

roly-poly fat cats, gay cats, cats wealthy, cats of weight,

and each adorned with a mustache such as the Christians wear,
cats graceful as if they danced on ice, cats swifter than the wind,
cats with ribbons round their tails and looping through their hair.

And when at long last darkness falls upon the marketplace
and I’m engulfed by a sea of cats and find I cannot swim,
the people in the town will ask, their eyeballs popping out,
What will he do with all these cats? And what will become of him?
