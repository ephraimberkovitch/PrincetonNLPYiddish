Vilna

1

Someone in a tales is walking your rooftops.
Only he is stirring in the city by night.

He listens. Old gray veins quicken—sound
Through courtyard and synagogue like a hoarse, dusty heart.
You are a psalm, spelled in clay and in iron.
Each stone a prayer; a hymn every wall,

As the moon, rippling into ancient lanes,

Glints in a naked and ugly-cold splendor.

Your joy is sadness—joy of deep basses

In chorus. The feasts are funerals.

Your consolation is poverty: clear, translucent—
Like summer mist on the edges of the city.

You are a dark amulet set in Lithuania.

Old gray writing—mossy, peeling.

Each stone a book; parchment every wall.

Pages turn, secretly open in the night,

As, on the old synagogue, a frozen water carrier,
Smail beard tilted, stands counting the stars.

Only I am stirring in the city by night.

No sound. Houses are rigid—bales of rag.

A tallow candle flutters, dripping,

Where a cabalist sits, tangled into his garret,
Like a spider, drawing the gray thread of his life.
“Is there anyone in the cold emptiness?

In our deafness—can we hear the lost cries?”
