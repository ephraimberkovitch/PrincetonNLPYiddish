694 Abraham Sutzkever

Firemen

Firemen attacked me late at night
Like acrobats in a circus,
Sure-footed

on their tall ladders

flung up quick as a shot

to the sixth floor.

 

Firemen.

Rivers on their shoulders.

Helmets. Axes.

Strip the living flesh from my innocent walls.
A mirror cracks.

Pays me back a debt: a sliver of face.
Shovels. Streams of water.

The pillars of the air

shudder.

Down below, a crowd

with an outstretched net

raises a clamor—

they have weak hearts—

shouting that I should take pity at once
and jump.

 

Meanwhile, reclining like a king

on the sixth floor,

reading (of all things)

a poet of the thirteenth century,

I am amazed

the firemen have attacked me at night
with axes, helmets, and raw nerve—
and with what fervor they

won't let me burn.
