Eygns in 1920, and she was briefly associated
with its young Yiddish writing group. In 1922 she moved to War-
saw, where she taught in the local Yiddish secular schools until her
departure for America in 1935. She wrote children’s poems and
stories on a more mature level than was common, adopting
something of the same open, naive style in her ‘adult’ verse.
Modern and confessional, particularly in the exploration of
women’s themes, Molodovsky was also deeply attached to Jewish
folkways. She wrote of Jewish experience during the Second World
War and of the birth of Israel in its aftermath. An active literary
presence in New York, she edited the literary journal Svive in
1943—44 and revived it in the 1960s.
