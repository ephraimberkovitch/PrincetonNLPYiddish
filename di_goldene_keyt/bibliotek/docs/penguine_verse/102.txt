 

Yitskhok Leybush Perets

There are goblins in the ruin,

imps that crow and laugh for spite,
bark, meow,

and haunt at night,

hurl stones through the air

from their lair

at the houses underneath;

and on the roof

in the dark

a wild dog with tangled fell,
always on the prowl,

who never has been heard to bark,
he only grinds his teeth.

Flesh and blood tremble.

Jews and Christians both

stay well away from that street
and its tumbledown houses overgrown with weeds.

One night in the shadow of the walls

a solitary figure creeps toward the ruin;
all along the street there’s no one else:
it’s Monish clutching his lapels.

Two angels go with him,

one on either side;

the evil on the left,

and the good, weeping tears, on the right.

His good angel whispers in his ear,
“Have pity on yourself,

fear the Lord your God.

He created all the world,

heaven, earth,

and the seventy nations

who live by the sword.

But the essence of all people

are the Jews, whom He treasured,

and for them He weighed and measured
six hundred and thirteen commandments.
