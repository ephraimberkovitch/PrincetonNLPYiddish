346 Perets Markish

Because many of Perets Markish’s short poems are untitled in the original
Yiddish, we have left them untitled in the English as well.

The rinsed fences dry themselves in the wind.

The kneaded black earth turns softer under my feet.
Soaked soil, tousled and wanton wind,

What more can I want from you today?

It seems to me that I’ve seen you

For the very first time in the world,

And I, a child,

Own you completely today.

Red cattle, their bottoms smeared,
Their udders swollen,

Lie down in the mud-black dale.
And in my hushed heart there lies
A young delight

In the warm silent morning,

In last year’s withered hay,

In the unharnessed horses.

I want to hug all the cows,
To lie on the ground with them,
And bellow along with them.

Leonard Wolf

The day’s not enough for my idle meandering.

And the night too short for my sprawling in beds.

What is the world’s dazzle set against the thirst of an eye?

And what barrier the dark of the world against my blazing
heart?

The path is too short for the uncertainty of my goal.
For my wild tenacity, the wind is too slothful and sleepy.
