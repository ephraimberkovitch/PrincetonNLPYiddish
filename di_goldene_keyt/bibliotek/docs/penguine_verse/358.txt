(this is the dream I love best of all),
Where the sacred wine fizzes in bottles.

Let me have one sip, here on East Broadway,

for the sake of those old Jews crying in the dark.
I cry my heretic’s tears with them,

their sobbing is my sobbing.

 

I'm a difficult passenger, my ship

is packed with the heavy horns, the shofars of grief.
Tighten the sails of night as far as you can,

for the daylight cannot carry me.

Take me somewhere to a place of rest,

of goats in belled hats playing on trombones—
to the Almighty’s fresh white sheets

where the hunter’s shadow cannot fall.

Take me... . Yes, take me... . But you know best
where the sea calmly opens its blue road.

I’m wearier than your oldest tower;

somewhere I’ve left my heart aside.

Adrienne Rich

God of Mercy

O God of Mercy

Choose—

another people.

We are tired of death, tired of corpses,
We have no more prayers.

Choose—

another people.

We have run out of blood

For victims,

Our houses have been turned into desert,
The earth lacks space for tombstones,
