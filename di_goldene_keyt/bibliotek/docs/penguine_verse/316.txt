288 Leyb Naydus

Soft as a peacock feather, cruel as a fury,

Your earrings, the old coins against your breast,
Gleam strangely, as if just unearthed in Syrian
Ruins, from centuries of sleep in dust.

Lie on the carpet, wild and tender. Open
The pomegranate of your mouth, and close
Your eyes: Astarte stands above us, keeping
Guard like a eunuch with her watchful gaze.

To be alone. Alone. Entirely free.
Forgetting all my longing, all desire.
A faithful dog; a bottle of Tokay;
A good cigar; a fire.

To be alone; alone. Let it roar outside,

Let the modern Sodom rage and scream.
The fairest roses will bloom: my solitude;
In like a swan will swim the fairest dream.

To be alone; alone. To meet no one,

To shake from me the weight of everyday.

And should the empty noise come knocking: Open!
I'll leave the unwelcome guest in the entryway.

Naomi Wolf

Now, after Grandmotherâ€™s death, I come for the greetings
Of distant generations, to her room,

And leaf through books in old, faded, amazing
