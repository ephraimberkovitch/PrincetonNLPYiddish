212 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

When bloodshed needs background music, that few
Gentiles can’t sing the Kol Nidre too.

John Hollander

 

Two Italian immigrant workers, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
were found guilty on a first-degree murder charge in Massachusetts, and
although the verdict was called into question they were executed in the
electric chair on April 23, 1927. Liberals protested that the men had been
sentenced for their anarchist beliefs rather than for any crime they had
committed, and radicals used the case to attack the American system of
justice. Many Yiddish poets and writers wrote commemorative works on
this subject.

Sacco—Vanzetti

You can pull from your head a gray hair

That sometimes comes too early with troubles that are too hard,

But for someone whose troubled head

Feels too hard with its skin and hair,

Too hard to bear any more

On these two wretched bones called—in humans—

Shoulders;

Let him not stand there, mouth and eyes agape,

As in some madhouse:

The stone of the wall is harder than his head,

And to hit himself against it will only yield a lump

No larger than an apple in a tree, that withers

With no one to pick it in due season.

And today, after all, there’s an easier way

For anyone who looks for it:

You have only to keep quiet for a while

And submit your head, like a typhus patient, to someone who
shaves it.

Kol Nidre: the opening prayer of the service on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atone-
ment, when Jews seek absolution from their sins.
