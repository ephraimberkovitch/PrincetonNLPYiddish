Crazy Levi

And no one knows what became of him, Crazy Levi,
who tied the roads

from Yaverev to Moshtsisk

to Samber to Greyding in a bow,

carrying always in his bosom pocket

his letters to Rivtshe,

his uncle’s youngest daughter.

All the houses in the villages knew him,
the road accepted his long shadow

like a horse that knows its rider,

and the dogs lay quiet in their doghotises
when the familiar smell of Levi’s black coat
spoke to their hearts.

Women broken in the middle like sheaves

were in the field when Levi came by.

They toyed with him

and with a laugh that smelled of goodness, like dark bread,
they would say,

“Levi, you have no father or mother.

Why don’t you take a wife

like the rest of your people?

She would wash your shirt for you

and cook you a spoonful of something warm for supper.”

And Levi would look at their raw, swollen feet

and plow the brown field of his forehead

with the painful thought that was always present to him:
“Because my uncle wouldn't give me his daughter for a wife.
I carry my heart around

like a cat in a sack,

and J] want to leave it somewhere

so that it won’t be able to find its way back to me.”’

Yaverev (Yavorév), Moshtsisk (Mostishche), Samber (Sambér), and Greyding:
small towns in the area of Lvov.
