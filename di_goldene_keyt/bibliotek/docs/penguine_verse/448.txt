Korets Landscape

In Korets, my city in Volhynia,
there were tall, wiry thieves.

I saw them in chains:

Strong, broad, they walked on the road,
and the guards who escorted them
reached to their shoulders.

Were it not for their flashy buttons
and tall hats

and dangling swords,

I would have looked away.

The thieves, captured in broad daylight,
in the church cellar,

who were chased through the cavern
for half a day,

soared with heads high.

Pigeons flew from the church;
children burst forth from the streets.
I see the tumult now,

though years have passed:

even the priest with blond braid,
chain slung across his back,
followed the crowd.

Their height and their power,

their silence, their gentle smiles,
persist even today.

I say lehavdl, lehavdl,
lehavdl, lehavdl,

lehavdl (Heb. lehavdil): Yiddish uses the word lehavdl to indicate the transitions

between, for example, Gentile and Jew, or profane and holy.
