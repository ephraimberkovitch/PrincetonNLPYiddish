436 Jacob Glatstein

Dews weep

on dead grass.

The dream raped,

reality raped,

both blotted out.

Whole congregations sleep,
the babies, the women,

the young, the old.

Even Your pillars, Your rocks,
the tribe of Your saints,
sleep their dead

eternal sleep.

 

Who will dream You?
Remember You?

Deny You?

Yearn after You?

Who will flee You,

only to return

over a bridge of longing?

No end to night

for an extinguished people.
Heaven and earth wiped out.
Your tent void of light.
Flicker of the Jews’ last hour.
Soon, Jewish God,

Your eclipse.

Cynthia Ozick

“The tribe of Your saints”: This recalls the legend of the lamed vov tsadikim,
the thirty-six anonymous Just Men for the sake of whose great merit the
world is preserved. (The Hebrew letters lamed and vov have the numerical
equivalent of 36.)
