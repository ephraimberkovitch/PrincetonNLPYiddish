Fooling the aged fathers into thinking,
“Good fortune flies like that, when fortune flies.”
And they suspect the proof of their old eyes.

The watchman, gray and grumbling, stands before
His lamp and asks, ‘Art thou my destiny?

Too bad.” A nurse is bandaging a star

That only lately fell out of the sky.

Trains, in the distance, go and come again;
Deserted wives, at stations, await their men.

Stumbling on the roads, moonwalkers yearn

To find the moon; they search with tender hands
And feel about, but only touch cold rain.

They sob, “Oh, woe is us. The night erases
From our memories familiar traces;

It wipes our shadows out, and all our homes;
And there is no one left who knows our names.”

The youthful murderer in prison waits

The coming of the dawn that is to bring

The moment of delight when he will hang

And twitch. Upon the wall, his shadow burns.

The young man asks, ‘How could you?” of his hands,
And gets no answer he can understand.

Seven ancient women croak—‘‘November.”

All through the town, the clocks begin their ringing.
My body, here beside you, burns, Anyela.

Listen. How beautifully sick owls are singing.

One by one, the funerals take flight;

The graves are young and ready, and they wait.
