there’s a button, believe it or not,
that when you press it, presto!—
there’s tsholnt in a pot.

They say that he’s religious.
Hebrew—he’s got it pat.
His tales is a cloudlet
captured on Ararat.

Black pearls he has for ¢filn,

its straps, gold through and through.

if only he wanted to.

Now see him drawn in his carriage
by a roly-poly steed,

looking, I must tell you,

“Oh, my dear, dear brethren
scattered in the wind like sand,
T return to you in sorrow,

for your sorrow I understand.
