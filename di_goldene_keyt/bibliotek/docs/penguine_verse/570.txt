Twelve Autumn Lines

Scarlet trees are spitting blood of leaves
and flies are dying on filthy windowpanes.

Ripe, my heart falls from the Tree of Knowledge,
rotting with a spitlike stickiness.

Come, pour me out a sleeping draught of kisses.
Like dead flies I shall be lying, lying ...

And till a thunderclap come to awake me,
spin a Grieg autumn melody around me.

On the black piano, play for me, black sister,
play ethereal sorrow, art and falsehood.

Until the shattering thunder opens graves
and God's lightning falls on children in their cradles.
