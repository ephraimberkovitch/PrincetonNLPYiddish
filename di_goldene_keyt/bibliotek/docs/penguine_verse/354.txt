Everything swims away. Brightness and white clothes.
Red and green and blinding flutter.

A circle starts up around my head

which is undergoing thorny and hard torment.

Invitation

My God, like a beloved great-uncle

you lived in every corner of our house.

Invite me now—right now!—to be your guest.

Let me taste your Great Ox and drink your old wine.

And make it simple, on some Wednesday out of the blue
(just set a pretty footstool for me there).

There’s one of your worlds I haven’t been crazy about,
its rulers frighten me ... so you mustn’t tell.

You play such odd tricks

on your lovely flower garden,

and in New York even on your chosen Israel,

which laments our destruction, laments and cuts the deck.

And send your most ravishing angel for me,
so that I may fly lightly to your Temple,
yes, send your very most ravishing angel
that my last glance go out with a smile.

1940 Irving Feldman

offered after the coming of the Messiah.

footstool: according to Jewish folk tradition, wives who live uprightly in
this life will be rewarded in the next by a footstool at their husband’s side.
