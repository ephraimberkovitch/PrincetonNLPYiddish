 

454 Jacob Glatstein

Nathan, inscribe.

At night, if you have an ear,

You will hear how each gate of the 310 worlds

Weeps with one voice:

Flesh.

Do you think the music found in such longing is trivial?
And that’s the bit of joy (alas, it need saying)

Between heaven and earth

Until the shards are pressed to the eyelids.

It’s the precious tune of a heartfelt song of great praises.
You know well how tormented my flesh is,

But my heart weeps for that remnant of pleasure.

The instinct for lust means one and in union;

Splendid provocation.

It means a trembling word;

Fire and flames and God’s braiding of two—

It means woman.

Nathan, inscribe.

1 know, though indeed it’s fearful to let the lips speak it...
It’s late at night.

Nathan, I give you words that are not to be caught with the ear.
It may, God forbid, lead to confusion.

“Well,” they will cry. ‘Does he mean, perhaps,

To condone the adulterer?”

Yet, what do I mean to say?

My heart goes out to the instinct for lust.

It is force, after all, desire and longing,

Power and strength,

And it’s song, after all,

And grief, and secret beginnings,

310 worlds: Though the etymology of this phrase is uncertain, it is the
blessing bestowed on the righteous in the world to come.
