And we, the ones still calling you “Grandfather,”
Knowing we may not call you that for long—
We are ascending, like the sound first heard,
The sound first heard of an oncoming joy,

We, the ones still calling you “Grandfather.”

It’s good to peer into your lonely eyes

When the sorrow of your beards is strange... .
We-—I and he and they—it is our fate,

It is our fate never to bow again.

Pass on, pass on, you lonely eyes,

Leonard Wolf

The poet regrets that he cannot speak of the shtetl—the declining Jewish
market town, or village—with the same natural filial attachment that is to
be found in the verse of the Russian poet Sergei Esenin (1895—1925), who
called himself “the last poet of wooded Russia.” The poem is untitled in
the original Yiddish.

Here I bend my young head and am still,
And my heart’s unable to find peace.
Ah, withered twig, dear shtetl, shtetl,

I know that you desire to green again;

I move, a silent guest, and J keep still.

And I am touched by grief; by so much sorrow—
And I’m so envious of Esenin.

I too would like to come to you

And, singing, call you mother.

I'm so sorry, shtetl, oh, so sad.
