170 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

I dance wildly, blindly past,
Street-out and street-in!

If I’m sick and old and gray,
Who could care, ha-ha-hey!
For only a copper coin, or tin,
As if to break

The drum, I bang

And then I make

The cymbals clang

And round and round about I spin—
Boom! Boom! Din-din-din!
Boom! Boom! Din!

A girl comes along, a sorceress,

A blaze ignites inside me; yes,

I dance more wildly round about,

And start to clench my teeth, and shout
As I twirl,

Hold hands, girl,

And grab me round while round we whirl:
Dancing’s hotter done in couples.

A girl like you—a killer, though—

Left me not so long ago.

My sick heart breaks with pain and troubles,
So as if to break

The drum, I bang

And then I make

The cymbals clang

And round and round about I spin—
Boom! Boom! Din-din-din!

Boom! Boom! Din!

Children laugh in sport and fun
But I don’t want to be outdone:
Shake a leg, kids! Hop on by,
One more punch, then, in the eye.
One more spit!

In spite of it

With one jump everything is quit.
