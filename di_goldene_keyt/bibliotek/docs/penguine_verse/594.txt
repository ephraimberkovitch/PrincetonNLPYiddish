The pony scrapes the gravel

As if it were saying, “Come on!
Give me a chance to show you
How to make the highway tame.”

“This is our portion, Ishmael;
Darling, dry your tears.

This is the way of the Fathers

With their long and reverend beards.”

She foresees herself abandoned
In a railroad waiting hall

In a foreign country and she sobs
Into her Turkish shawl.

“Hagar, stop that sniveling—
Woman, do you hear me or no?”
Hagar takes her bundle,

Hagar turns to go.

He stands with his silken cap on,
The pious Abraham—

“Dear mother, tell me, does he feel
My heart’s defeated pain?”

The whip sings out; they've started.
She sees, through tear-rimmed eyes,
The village houses slowly

Scrape backward in a haze.

She takes the earth and heaven

To be her witnesses:

This is the way of the Fathers

With their long and reverend beards.
