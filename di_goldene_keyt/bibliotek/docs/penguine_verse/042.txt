scraps of bread in a beggar’s sack. In an early version of Perets’s
narrative poem ‘“Monish,” we read:

Differently my song would ring

be felt in this passage (deleted from the later versions), as well as in
the self-mockery that pervades much of the poem.

stylization, comparable to what Mark Twain does for nineteenth-
century American speech. Among the poets there is constant ver-

that prose absorbs colloquial speech more readily than poetry
can—or at least than most poets suppose it can. For this is a time
when colloquial speech is considered too “low” for poetry. Prose
has the further advantage of appealing to a large audience of Yid-
dish readers for whom the stories of Sholem Aleichem and
