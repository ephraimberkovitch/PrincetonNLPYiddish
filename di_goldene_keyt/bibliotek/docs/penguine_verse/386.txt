358 Perets Markish

I yearn to merge with you in prayer
And yet my heart, my lips are moved
Only to blasphemies and curses.

Ah, my prayer-exhausted,
Tenfold dishonored hands turn.
Take them; take them.

Caress them, lick them, as a dog
Licks its scabby, suppurating hide.
I pledge them to you.

I’ve built you a new ark

In the middle of the marketplace.
A black mound, like a blotch.
Seat yourself upon its buxom roof
Like an old raven on a dungheap.

Take my heart, my prayer-exhausted heart,

And all such rubbish. Take it

And peck, peck what the chariot of twenty generations brought.
I pledge it to you.

A wander-stick rolls about
Waiting for your steps that follow
Cain’s unscrewed right legs.

I cool a capful

Of sanctifying blood

From Abel’s throat for you.

You, whom noise diminishes,

A black wagon full of mud-smeared
Sleeping passengers pulls up

And something, something stirs.

Ah, sucked from my eyes, streams of pitch
To cleanse the dead. Take them, take them.
