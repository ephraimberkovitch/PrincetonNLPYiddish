And He Himself who warned her
Says, ‘The tree is fair.’

And keeps the sunset lingering
Another moment more.

Each night, whether true or not,
She dreams this dream: A tear
Drops from the weeping apple tree
And falls into her hair.

“Lovely apple tree, don’t weep,

I am your melody

And know your word is stronger far
Than the Word that’s warning me.”

Then Eve enfolds the apple tree,
She clasps it in her arms

While far above, the pious stars
Tremble with alarm.

1041 Leonard Wolf

Hagar Leaves Abraham's House

The dawn is blue at the window,
Three times the rooster crowed.
Outside the horse is neighing,
Impatient for the road.

Hagar is worn with weeping;

Her child lies in her arms:

Once more she casts her eyes around
The gray, familiar room.

Outdoors, the teamster haggles
For his fare with Abraham:

“All right, six dollars, even,
After all, there are two of them.”
