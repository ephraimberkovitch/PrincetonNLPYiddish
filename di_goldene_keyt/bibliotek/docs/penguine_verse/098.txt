to hear her voice, so sweet.

Dressed all in velvet,

and when she spoke, to tell of it,

it was a fiddle playing.

Her laugh was a cascade of joy.

The porter under his load,

the hermit fasting and praying,

laughed when she laughed, and their own music flowed
when the music of her song came thronging,
and the fiddle spoke and sang,

sweet and full of longing.

Long, long, long,

on his way to his studies at the kloyz
day by day,

Monish passed her house,
lingered at the gate,

and his ears drank her song

till like wine it made him drunk
(an erring mortal, dust and ashes),
and when he turns to Rashi,

held by its power,

he hums the tune she sang

hour after hour.

The kloyz listens stunned

to such musical sorrow,

neither shepherd nor folk song,
so strong it draws the marrow
from your bones.

Perplexed,

Monish sits alone,

trembling as if he’d caught

a fever, his forehead white as chalk,
gazing past the holy text
