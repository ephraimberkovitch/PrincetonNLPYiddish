150 Yisroel-Yankev Schwartz

But the light of the Sabbath candles

couldn’t drive the weekday out;

the heartfelt prayers of the tkhines

fell shamed, pointless,

in the ears of her sons in this other land,

in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana,

on to Illinois and Kansas on one side

and states far to the north on the other.

he hated to talk about the lonesome long-ago,
and if a neighbor who knew him

in the days of his heavy pack

said, “Josh, by God, that pack

you brought into these parts...”

Josh humored him grudgingly

till he wandered on to another topic.

They still lived in the old house,

so clearly out of the past

compared to the unabashed new building.
His daughters were unhappy

 

tkhines: in this context, non-canonical Yiddish prayers, recited mainly by women.
