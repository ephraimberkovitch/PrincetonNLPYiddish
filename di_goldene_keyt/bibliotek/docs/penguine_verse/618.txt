Be sure to wear your fleece-lined cap;
Woe’s me, my heart is breaking.

And, pretty fool, be sure to take
Your woolen underwear

And put it on, unless you mean
To lie a corpse somewhere.”

I try to fly, but ] can’t move. .

Too many, many things

My mother’s piled on her weak bird
And loaded down my wings.

I look into my mother’s eyes

And, sadly, there I see

The love that won’t let me become
The bird I want to be.

Leonard Wolf

Written in 1958, on the eve of Manger’s departure for Israel, this poem
recalls the great twelfth-century Hebrew poet, Judah Halevi, whose pas-
sionate ‘Songs of Zion” presaged his emigration to the Holy Land. The
twentieth-century Yiddish poet echoes some of the sentiments of his
Hebrew predecessor: “I would bow down, my face on your ground; I
would love your stones; your dust would move me to pity. | would weep,
as I stood by my ancestors’ graves; I would grieve, in Hebron, over the
choicest of burial places.” (T. Carmi, The Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse,
p. 348.) But Manger feels less the pilgrim than the object of his own long-
ing. In place of the patriarchs’ graves that the medieval poet determines to
seek out, Manger cites Lake Kinneret, home of the first modern settlers.

For years I wallowed

For years I wallowed about in the world,

Now I’m going home to wallow there.

With a pair of shoes and the shirt on my back,

And the stick in my hand that goes with me everywhere.
