Morris Rosenfeld

The Sweatshop

Corner of Pain and Anguish, there’s a worn old house:
tavern on the street floor, Bible room upstairs.
Scoundrels sit below, and all day long they souse.

On the floor above them, Jews sob out their prayers.

Higher, on the third floor, there’s another room:
not a single window welcomes in the sun.
Seldom does it know the blessing of a broom.
Rottenness and filth are blended into one.

Toiling without letup in that sunless den:
nimble-fingered and (or so it seems) content,

sit some thirty blighted women, blighted men,
with their spirits broken, and their bodies spent.

Scurf-head struts among them: always with a frown,
acting like His Royal Highness in a play;

for the shop is his, and here he wears the crown,
and they must obey him, silently obey.
