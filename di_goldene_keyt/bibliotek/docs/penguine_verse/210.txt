 

Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

The bird bends his wing to shade his eyes
—Just like my brother Sam—and cries,
Through the keyhole, that his luck should shine
Maybe so blindingly as mine,

Because, he says, he’s seen my bit

Of cheese, and he'll crack my skull for it.

It’s not so nice here anymore.

So I wiggle slowly toward the door,
Holding my chair and that bit of cheese
Under my ass, behind my knees,
Quietly. But then, as if I care,

I ask him whether it’s cold out there.

They are frozen totally,

Both his poor ears, he answers me,
Declaring with a frightful moan
That, while he lay asleep alone

He ate up his leg—the one-he’s lost.
If J let him in, I can hear the rest.

When I hear the words “ate up,” you can bet
That I’m terrified; I almost forget

To guard my bit of hidden cheese

Under my ass there, behind my knees.

But I reach below and, yes, it’s still here,

So I haven't the slightest thing to fear.

Then I move that we should try a bout
Of waiting, to see which first gives out,
His patience, there, behind the door,
Or mine, in my own house. And more
And more I feel it’s funny, what

A lot of patience I have got.

And that’s the way it’s stayed, although
That was some seven years ago.

I still call out “Hi, there!’ through the door.
He screams back ‘’’Lo, there’ as before.
