408 Moyshe Kulbak

Raziel is standing before him; he gleams in the darkness.
The wings an old, faded parchment.

The eyes—pits filled with sand and with cobweb.

“There is no one. Only sorrow is left.’””

The candle drips. Stupefied, the weak man listens.

He suckles the darkness out of the angel's sockets.

The garrets breathe—lungs of

The hunchbacked creature who is drowsing in the hills.

O city! You are the dream of a cabalist,

Gray, drifting in the universe—cobweb in the early autumn.

You are a psalm, spelled in clay and in iron.

The letters fading. They wander—stray.

Stiff men are like sticks; women, like loaves of bread.
The shoulders pressed. Cold, secretive beards.

Long eyes that rock, like rowboats on a lake—

At night, late, over a silver herring,

They beat their breasts. “God, we are sinful. . . sinful.”
The moon’s white eye, bulging through the tiny panes,
Silvers the rags that hang on the line,

Children in beds—yellow, slippery worms,

Girls half undressed, their bodies like boards—

These gloomy men are narrow like your streets.

The brow mute—a rigid wall of a synagogue yard.
The eyebrows mossy: like a roof above your ruins.
You are a psalm inscribed upon the fields.

A raven, I sing to you by the flow of the moon.

No sun has ever risen in Lithuania.

4

Your joy is sorrow—joy of deep basses

In chorus. The quiet Maytime is somber.

Saplings grow from the mortar. Grasses push from the wall.
Sluggishly, a gray blossom crawls out of the old tree.

The cold nettle has risen through mud.

Raziel: an angel mentioned in Midrashic and magical literature connected with
the mysteries of God.
