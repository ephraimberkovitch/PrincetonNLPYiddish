Frozen Jews

Have you seen, in fields of snow,
frozen Jews, row on row?

Blue marble forms lying.
Not breathing. Not dying.

Somewhere the flicker of a frozen soul—
glint of fish in an icy swell.

All brood. Speech and silence are one.
Night snow encases the sun.

A smile glows immobile
from a rose lip’s chill.

Baby and mother, side by side.
Odd that her nipple’s dried.

Fist, fixed in ice, of a naked old man:
the power’s undone in his hand.

I’ve sampled death in all guises.
Nothing surprises.

Yet a frost in July in this heat—
a crazy assault in the street.

I and blue carrion, face to face.
Frozen Jews in a snowy space.

Marble shrouds my skin.
Words ebb. Light grows thin.

I’m frozen, I’m rooted in place
like the naked old man enfeebled by ice.

Moscow,
