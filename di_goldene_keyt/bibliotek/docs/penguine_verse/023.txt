ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

n the hope of providing the best available English transla-

tions of Yiddish poetry, we have taken—with the kind per-
mission of publishers and editors—a number of translations from
A Treasury of Yiddish Poetry, edited by Irving Howe and Eliezer
Greenberg, published by Holt, Rinehart & Winston.

We thank the following friends and colleagues for their help and
suggestions in compiling this book: Abraham Sutzkever, Gabriel
Preil, Dan Miron, Nathan Cohen, Eugene Orenstein, David
Roskies, and the late Max Hayward. Without the initiative of Dan
Davin, longtime friend of the Yiddish poet Itsik Manger, the book
might not have been conceived.
