662 Judd Teller

The sunset, color and melody,
enchants windowpanes and rooftops
and beaten Jews

on their beds of torture.

The city darkens against the night sky,
threatens, like the peasant’s fist;
darkens, like his mind.

Grace Schulman

This is a later variant of the poem ‘Jew Suss Oppenheimer on His First
Visit to Professor Sigmund Freud.”

His Relative Confides in
Professor Sigmund Freud

You, clear of vision, farsighted, penetrating,
take me like grain in your fist,

an egg against the light.

We are of the same blood.

Shackled Yeshiva students who skipped
inside a fence of forbidding laws;

the king’s dealers

who carried Torah scrolls

and swept the dust with their beards
when the bishop approached,

take me on hectic walks,

clamor like beggars in cemeteries.

In my blue hours with a gentile’s daughter,
they remind me of my sister, who was raped.
