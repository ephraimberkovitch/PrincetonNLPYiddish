in which she finally burned.

And say how in spirited hours
she struggled hard with God,
and how her blood sang deep
and small men ruined her.

Girls in Crotona Park

Girls have woven themselves into autumn evenings
as in a faded picture.

Their eyes are cool, their smiles wild and thin,
their dresses lavender, old rose, apple green.

Dew flows through their veins.

Their talk is bright and empty.

Botticelli loved them in his dreams.

Entrâ€™acte

The delicate weave of clever talk
like a spiderweb shaken by wind
has suddenly torn.

Bemused, a slow smile on her lips,
through the clatter of silence

the way you sense a wolf in your sleep:
glazed, golden eyes,

taut ribs,

paws stiff and ready to pounce.
Dizzying rings tighten around her.

Crotona Park: the Bronx, New York, park was a popular meeting place for
Yiddish writers who lived in. the neighborhood.
