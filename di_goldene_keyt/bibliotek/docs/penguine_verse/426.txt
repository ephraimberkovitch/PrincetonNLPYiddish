He was tan and excited. His eyes glowed and his hair was
disheveled,
He found her at last in the grass—half afraid, half delighted.

She was scared, as a pullet might be when sunlight pierces a
shower.

Then Nastasya was caught in his arms; he embraced her,

And kissed her tanned throat, though she trembled,

Till, startled by pleasure, she wriggled against him

And pressed herself silently to him, closer and closer.

Grandfather Dying...

Gray as a dove, toward evening, my grandfather came from the
pasture;

He made up his bed and said a-prayer of confession,

Then inwardly bade his farewell to the world

And closed his eyes, utterly exhausted.

My uncles came in and gathered around at his bedside;
Bowing their shaggy heads they stood about, silent;

Something clutched at their hearts that left them all wordless—
Clutched at their hearts and kept them from sighing.

Then slowly my grandfather opened his eyes, and a smile

Spread over his face; he sat up, though it cost him much trouble;

And here’s what he said to his sons: “You, my Ortsheh,

You've been the family keystone;

First in the field and the last one to sit at the table. The earth
opened warmly to you and your plowshare.

May your seed, like the earth, be forever as fresh and as fertile.

And you, Rakhmiel, who is like you in the meadow?

Your scythe in the field was an outburst of fire.

You are known to the birds in the air; to the snakes in their
marshes.

May my blessing rest on your barn; and blessed be your stable.
