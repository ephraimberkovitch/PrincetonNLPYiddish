Railroad Thieves

Train track distances reflect with the chill light of signals.

Fired-up locomotives with perpetual smoke and thick sparks
resound,

Out of the wild, red fumes, bleak evenings settle on nearby panes

On which the shadows of deep curving woods, of open freight
trains,

Carrying coals and boards from faraway cities are cast.

Mothers and fathers lie in wait for dark cars carrying coal;

Heavy sacks have stooped their shoulders; stealing makes their
hands tremble. /

For the pregnant women, carrying the coal to their bleak panes,
the stealing,

In the wild red smoke of the passing freights, is more dreadful still.

In their homes, broad beds and holy pictures; the thick steam of
cooked foods.

Narrow homes. Lust in such narrow homes is stronger, hotter.

In such homes, the just-removed blouse of an older sister is easy
to see.

Sisters whose shoulders at dawn are blue with the toothmarks of
railway gangs.

Their bodies quick to be pregnant, give painless birth on the
nearest street.

Train boys from collieries, slaughterhouses, from sawmills and
freight cars;

Their clothes of rough fabric, well acquainted with sticks and with
ropes;

Neither glass, nor tin, nor rods can damage their hands any more,

And their bare feet are toughened so well they no longer bleed.

Mary, with Jesus in her arms, stands by the road where they live,

Walled in a cornice of glass and glowing with eternal light.

Mother Mary is full of compassion for thieves such as these.

She does not require their tears; for her their confession is pure
when they make it.
