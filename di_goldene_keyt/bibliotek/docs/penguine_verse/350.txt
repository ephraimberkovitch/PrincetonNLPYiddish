Mother Sarah brings clear honey

on tiny trays

to their tired mouths.

To poor brides of noble birth,

ashamed to lay their trousseau of patches
under their mother-in-law’s eye,

Mother Rebecca brings camels

heaped with white linen.

And when darkness spreads out around them
and all the camels kneel down to rest,
Mother Rebecca measures out ell after ell of linen
from the rings of her hand

to her golden bracelet.

For those whose eyes are weary

from gazing after every neighborhood child
and whose hands are thin from longing

for a small soft body

and a cradle’s rocking,

Mother Rachel brings healing leaves

from faraway mountains,

and comforts them with a kind word,

at any hour God may open the closed womb.
To those who weep at night on lonely beds
and have no one to bring their grief to,
murmuring to themselves with burnt lips,

to them Mother Leah comes softly

and covers their eyes with her pale hands.

1924 Irving Feldman

A Stool at the Head of My Bed

Dawn. Blueness comes down.

But I don’t recognize this bed.

One of my good brothers must have

let me lean on him for some sleep last night.
