Batlonim

Homes were built, houses, shops,

and a household prepared for them.
“My house,” “my wife,” “my child”:
they call each by its proper name.

They name all these things but they feel
that like white snowy dazzle

these things melt away, coolly touched
by their hands, shadowy, fragile.

And they themselves feel: it’s not real.

Their own bodies seem absurd,

though like all Jews they go to the bathhouse
and put on a freshly laundered shirt. . . .

They can become fathers and grandfathers,
even live to grow long white beards,

but it seems to them someone invented
this tale as a joke to be heard.

Amazed, they move through this fable

like children awakened in fear

from the blue of their dreams, like stars in night’s well—
nearby, yet not really here.

Batlonim: The term referred originally to “men of leisure’ who freed themselves
from work in order to serve the needs of the community and to be available
for synagogue service. In Yiddish it came to mean impractical men, idlers,
who could not make their way in their world.
