20 Aaron Glants-Leyeles

No one, except himself.
And if he could cerebrate an answer
He would not ask.

In these days of straight railway tracks,
Fabius Lind is not awake at all. i
He wanders about, hours, days,
Dreaming nonexistences:

A nonexisting age,

A country that doesn’t exist,
People that don’t exist,

A Fabius Lind who doesn’t exist.
Yes, yes, he would!

He would...

He would...

The desire, the thought flies off on an uninvited wind,
And returns like a ball of smoke.
Fabius Lind has never been well served
by the accounting mind.
Leonard Wolf

Bolted Room

Dark and bolted room.

Air dense and steeped in fear and danger,
Fabius Lind is eye to eye

With a remarkable woman.

Fabius Lind is small and trembles.

The woman, large and growing—

And torrential with heavy-bodied smells:
Smell of a stable,

Of summer afternoons in forest thickets.
Powerful limbs and powerful feet.

Fabius Lind is scared, and death

Seems good to him.

The smells enfold him,

Take away his will. Death seems good to him.
