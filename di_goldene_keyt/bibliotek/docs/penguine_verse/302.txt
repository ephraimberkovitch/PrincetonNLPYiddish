Epilogue

Because the papers meanly ignore me—

they think my luncheon menus not fit to print—
small wonder girls don’t give me a tumble

and day by day my stock goes down.

And every day my debts get higher.

Vainly my ten fingers stretch out for patrons.
It’s lucky Martel’s isn’t beyond my reach
and coffee—black—is still a nickel.

If coffee goes up, I'll go and hang myself,

and how many poets are as classy as me?

But while the coffee’s cheap, my marvelous songs
will bring happiness to our people and our tongue.

This Evening

Evening in the house

where you sit and look out

the window,

and in her chair your wife is knitting

or maybe sewing.

You turn around—and she is sitting there
doing nothing,

the needle, scissors, cloth

are lying idle in her hands,

and she is lost in thought over the days and days
that creep by in worries.

Here, we say, everything is always missing

and the daily grind is inescapable.

And every day that’s gone is gone for good,

it won’t come back again.

And just as this one has, the next too will pass,
and what was hoped for, waited for,

will also have gone past.
