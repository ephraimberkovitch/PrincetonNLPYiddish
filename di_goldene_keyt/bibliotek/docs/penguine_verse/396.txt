 

368 Perets Markish

On the mute walls of empty shops

Whose bored windows yawn over marketplaces,
Clocks, hairy as decapitated calves’ heads, hang
And lick, like a pendulum, back and forth, the void.

One moment here—on the swallowing side—

An instant there, and the business is done.

The hovering foam’s small change is silently counted.
And raised hands turn time on.

And houses, like medicinal leeches, suck
Earthly shoulders. Ah, cadaver of boredom,
Shaking time violently here and there,
Don’t set your dozen eyes on me.

I don’t want to know how the past is defined.
I don’t want to know what time it is!
I don’t want to know my age.

It’s good, it’s good not to shield the heart this way
From black smoke and windy rains;

Ah, somewhere in the world a mother blesses
Candles over seven weekdays for her children.

Why do I need the Sabbath with its rest and couches;

Who'll drink the Sabbath through such dreary windowpanes?

Somewhere, a father, like a hunched, complaining tree with
crooked branches,

Gives his blessing to the rain.

To the threshing floor. Days like autumn sheaves, lay
themselves down,

Nor will the thresher wind delay its prayer.

My head, like a stalk, I’ll not deny you, scythe.

Nor yet accuse you, as I would a mother, wind.
