442 Jacob Glatstein

If you start thinking.

Today, you'll have to shut

Your thinker behind locked doors.
Today, we are innocent singers
Who can hardly count up to two.
D’you get it—

How splendid it is?

One—echod;

One, and only one,

And always, one;

And again, and once more—echod.
Listen—how simple;

How lonely, how lovely, how sadly beautiful.
One—echod.

 

Seedling sing!
Honeybee, hum!
Caress the flower.
Little cloud, rain!
Refresh the roads;
Make the earth drunk.

Nathan, night will fall soon.

Let us sleep without thought—without dream,
Like the dear peasants.

Let’s put that ladder away,

Nor climb toward heaven today,

Down and up; up and down.

Let the angels clamber about.

Let us catch a snooze and a snort

And leap up at dawn to greet the fiery east
With our song:

Dai-donna-dai, dai-donna-dai.

echod: The One, the principle of God’s oneness, articulated in the prayer,
“Hear, O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One.”
climb the ladder: a reference to Jacob’s dream.
