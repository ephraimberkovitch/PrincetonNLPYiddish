414 Yankev-Yitskhok Segal

In Me

I will carry you across

all the blind waters.

You have yet to live; (

you've barely stuck your head
out of your hidden bud.
Death has mixed its colors

in your cool blood;

death has carved its notch

on your white throat.

You will inhabit me

in the quiet place,

the narrow path /
between stones in a graveyard.

Grace Schulman

Winter

My father woke at dawn
and found death at the table
in the empty gray house.

Death rose from the bench,
cane in hand,

came to his bed

and said, like a Jewish stranger:

Reb Aaron Ber,

you're not well;

itâ€™s still and white;

the road is easy and silent.
Look: just hold on to me
and off we'll go.

And off they went.
They passed the synagogue.
