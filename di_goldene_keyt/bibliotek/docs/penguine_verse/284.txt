Homer—a field of brightness, a forest of fragrance;
Royal stags roam there; gently, birds rise higher;

Young lambs leap to the singing of green earth;
But heaven’s own eye is Isaiah.

Homer danced on the hillsides with laughing nymphs;
His splendid creature, Man, plucked bow and lyre.
But “Purge thyself of the buck’s darkness, the deer’s’’

So man must declare in Isaiah.

Homer left Hector to the savage dogs,
Had Achilles rob him of his funeral pyre.
Inferring the Fallen State from the infant's tear,
The bitter words rushed from Isaiah.

How wonderful bearded Homer’s gold and green,
His rare blue universe, crystal entire!

But the world will only glow for the stranger among you
When victory comes to Isaiah.
