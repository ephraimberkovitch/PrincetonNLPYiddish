Once I Was Young

Once I was young, hung out

in doorways, listening to Socrates.
My closest pal, my lover

had the finest chest in Athens.

Then came Caesar, and a world
glittering with marble—I

the last to go. For my bride,

I picked out my proud sister.

At the late-night bashes, soused
and feeling fine, I’d hear

about the Nazareth weakling
and the exploits of the Jews.

Slender Ships

Slender ships drowse on swollen green water,
black shadows sleep on the cold heart of water.
All the winds are still.

Clouds shift like ghosts in the speechless night.

The earth, pale and calm, awaits thunder and lightning.
I will be still.

Marcia Falk

Dear Monsters

Dear monsters, be patient.

It’s sober day, and the world

overflows with light and sound

to its farthest sunny shores.

I go among the crowds, on friendly roads,
gratefully, miraculously

freed of you.
