but we sang our prayer book out

and leapt from stump to stump like boys.
Going back, we took the longer way,
over mountains and valleys, valleys and mountains.
And when we got home

with dusty feet and dry tongues,

at first sight

we didn’t recognize the barn and bridge,
the mill and house,

coming as we did from a different side
and at such an odd hour.

The Net

Bathed and fresh, the innkeeper’s son
came over and said,

Let’s go fishing in the Ravok.

The net was drying in the sun,

the paddle stood beside it—

a mother and her grown-up kid.

My pal was bigger than me

and older by a couple of years,

but when there are only three or four houses,
an unmatched pair is still—a pair.
Over his shoulder went the net and pole,
I carried the pail.

He was tall and strong

and I had to hustle

not to get left behind.

We got there pretty quick.

The Ravok was not

as wide as the sea

or as deep as the pit,

but its slender stream

ran over its soft bed

Ravok: a river near the poet’s birthplace.
