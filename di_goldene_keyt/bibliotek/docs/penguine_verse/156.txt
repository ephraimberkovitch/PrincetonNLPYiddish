Brownsville, a district in Brooklyn, was the location of many small shoe
factories during the early years of Jewish settlement in America. Yehupets
is the fictional name of a city adopted by Sholem Aleichem to represent
Kiev.

I am Mani Leyb, whose name is sung—

In Brownsville, Yehupets, and farther, they know it:
Among cobblers, a splendid cobbler; among
Poetical circles, a splendid poet.

A boy straining over the cobbler’s last
On moonlit nights ... like a command,
Some hymn struck at my heart, and fast
The awl fell from my trembling hand.

Gracious, the first Muse came to meet
The cobbler with a kiss, and, young,

I tasted the Word that comes in a sweet
Shuddering first to the speechless tongue.

And my tongue flowed like a limpid stream,
My song rose as from some other place;
My world’s doors opened onto dream;

My labor, my bread, were sweet with grace.

And all of the others, the shoemaker boys,

Thought that my singing was simply grand:
For their bitter hearts, my poems were joys.
Their source? They could never understand.

For despair in their working day’s vacuity
They mocked me, spat at me a good deal,
And gave me the title, in perpetuity,

Of Purple Patchmaker, Poet and Heel.

Farewell then, brothers, I must depart:
Your cobbler’s bench is not for me.
