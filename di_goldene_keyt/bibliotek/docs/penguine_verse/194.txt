I Say to Myself—

Why do you stand at the window like that?
Why don’t you go out in the street?

The street is for merchants and such
As measure their time in cash.

The street is for railways that fly
Like birds back and forth in the sky.
The street is for children and cats
Leaping like fish in nets.

The street is for drunkards as well,
Who wobble like smoke till they fall,
Wasting what's left of their days

As they stumble about in a maze.

Why don’t you shave—brush your clothes,
Go visit your old coffee house?

Like men in a bath, they all sit,

Naked and waiting to sweat,

Each crawling higher and higher.
Beating themselves, they perspire,
Flicking with whisks at their skulls

As they climb up the heat in the walls.

And talk! How they talk of themselves,

Of their wives and their griefs and their beds
Until they grow sleepy and close

Their eyes at the table and doze.

Buy flowers. Go knock on the door
Of that house where your old friends are.

I don’t care for such pride as Ill find,
Wooden faces, grown hard, grown unkind.
I don’t care for their riches. They shriek
Of fraudulent satin and silk.
