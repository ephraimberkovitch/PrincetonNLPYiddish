ITSIK FEFER

1900, Shpole, Ukraine—1952, place of death
unknown.

Fyoines the Russian Communist Party, and throughout the
1920s his poems combined revolutionary romanticism with sharp
antitraditionalist motifs. His robust lyricism celebrated hope in the
new social order, but he was also polemically outspoken against
those who placed aesthetic refinement and quavering individ-
ualism above the aims of political transformation. Though he was a
leading representative of Yiddish ‘Soviet Culture’ and occupied
many important positions as editor, publicist, and cultural bureau-
crat, he met the same fate as his fellow Yiddish writers. Arrested in
late 1948 or early 1949, he was executed on August 12, 1952.
