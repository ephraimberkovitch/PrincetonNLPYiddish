SHTOLTSENBERG

1905, Glinyany, then Galicia—1941, New York.

 

 

T Shtoltsenberg’s poetry remained rooted in Galician subjects
and childhood impressions. Taken in hand by Di Yunge, he was
encouraged to abandon the expressionistic “excesses” of his early
poetry in favor of controlled imagery, attentiveness to sensual
detail, “mastery over the language of things.’ Never prolific,
Shtoltsenberg was apparently discouraged by poverty and
loneliness and published nothing between 1932 and 1938. “The
Diary of the Straw Knight,” begun in 1938, a series of auto-
biographically inspired dramatic poems that are considered one of
the high points of American Yiddish poetry, remained unfinished
at the time of his death.
