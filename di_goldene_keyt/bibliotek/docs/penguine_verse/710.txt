682 Abraham Sutzkever

The entire series Epitaphs consists of twenty-seven parts. They are
dedicated to the poet's brother, Moyshe.

Epitaphs

You, letters scratched on walls

Of death houses, ghettoes, prison cells,
In every tongue, by a thousand hands,
In every shade that humans weep—
Amid you I discern my name,

Your song I shall forever hear.

Extinguish the stars! All over the earth,
Kindle, burn, supplant the stars!

Nowhere seek my song,

Or other fragment of my ravaged limbs—
Only, my one remaining brother,

Taste the redness of the rose;

Feel, with every barb,

A message sent up from below,

Where wonders unreleased

Stanch my poems’ flow.

Another life, unsavored, might hold

Spicier horrors; I do not know.

I sought no other wisdom than this—
Only to be, myself, both ground and plow,
Scooping up that force which willed me
Not to remain unborn forever.

For the grant of a world, I,

Your memorial blade of grass, give thanks.
