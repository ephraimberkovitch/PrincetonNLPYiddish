Shmuel Halkin

When glad Russian streets are before us?
To the end of our lives we are yours.

Until now we followed, unpledged to you,
Our wild birthright’s star far and wide.
But now we have fallen in step with you,
Though of your kisses we die.

1923 Hillel Halkin

Ah, When Will Dawn Begin to Break?

Between this wall and that I place
My hand on this cold pillowcase,
And on my hand I lay my head
Between those walls in this cold bed.

Through the endless night I keep
A long, cold vigil without sleep,
From last evening till tomorrow
Thinking of a thousand sorrows

Whose refrain’s so long it could
Last till doomsday if I should

Keep lying witlessly awake.

Ah, when will dawn begin to break?

In the dark am I in some sense
Burdened by an unclean conscience?
Its weight has never been so great.
Ah, when will dawn begin to break?

Have I betrayed a friend or brother,
Or, while mourning my own father,
Rejoiced in the poem he would make?
Ah, when will dawn begin to break?
