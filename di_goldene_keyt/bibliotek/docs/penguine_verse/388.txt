360 Perets Markish

A black wagon with mud-smeared, sleeping passengers
More being driven there, more being driven, still being . . .

Come! cross yourself and count them.
A shekel a head,

A shekel a head,

And thrust them—as always—
Thrust them from you.

I pledge them to you.

I pledge them to you.

Go slow. Pilgrim winds, from rocky lands and wild,

Will you now tread the brass and scarlet snows

Of the mound’s head?

Store food for a millennium and, wrapped in elephant hides,
Sanctify your wings with blood. I myself will guide you.

Here, like cliffs of hacked bellies,

Wells lurk around you.

Wild bones, gummed with a black hoof,

Protrude like giant horns,

Two thousand years of a fierce blizzard wandering in a well,
And still not yet arrived at the unsated depth.

Go slow. The mound climbs to lick the sky up like a plate of
cloudy calf’s-foot jelly,

To suck dry the hollow, scraped bone of the world.

Any moment now, red madness gushes to seas and distances.

Ah, pilgrim winds, you will yet tread upon my father’s prayer
shawl.

Though dead, there, on the mound, he delouses my sleeping
mother.

Go slow! After me, step by step. After me.
