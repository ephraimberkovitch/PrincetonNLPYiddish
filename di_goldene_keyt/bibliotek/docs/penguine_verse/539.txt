SHMUEL HALKIN
1897, Rogachev, White Russiaâ€”1960, Moscow.

H lyrics of the 1920s expressed his pain at seeing how Jewish
national existence had unavoidably begun to decline after the
Revolution. During the 1930s he also wrote historical dramas
and translated Pushkin and Shakespeare, including the famous
Moscow Yiddish Theatre production of King Lear. Arrested in
1950, he was spared execution because of ill health, but languished
in labor camps until 1955, after which he returned to Moscow.
