There is a tree that stands

There is a tree that stands
And bows beside the road.
All its birds have fled away,
Leaving not a bird.

The tree, abandoned to the storm,
Stands there all alone:

Three birds east, and three birds west—
The others south have flown.

To my mother then, I say,
“If you won't meddle, please,
I'll turn myself into a bird
Right before your eyes.

All winter, I'll sit on the tree
And sing him lullabies,
I'll rock him and console him
With lovely melodies.’””

Tearfully, my mother says,

“Don’t take any chances.

God forbid, up in the tree

You'll freeze among the branches.”

“Mother, what a shame to spoil
Your eyes with tears,” I said,

Then, on the instant, I transformed
Myself into a bird.

My mother cried, “Oh, Itsik, love . .
In the name of God,

Take a little scarf with you

To keep from catching cold.

And dear, put your galoshes on,
The winter’s cold and aching.
