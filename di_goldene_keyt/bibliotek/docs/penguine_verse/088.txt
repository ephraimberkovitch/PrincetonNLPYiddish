and their minds were as towers.
Other times,
other powers.

The house of study full,
and the people overflowed
to the entry and the step;
the lamp burned steady

past the middle of the night,
and judgment and Torah
abundant as the light.

Now mountain peaks are plentiful,

but the Bible’s Ararat

is not the average snowy

peak;

Ararat’s unique,

for there when the flood waters crested
Noah’s ark rested,

and the One Above Us drew the line;
and, as: we've heard,

granted life forever to the earth.

“Dear people,” He said, “steal, betray, and slaughter.
You will not be drowned in water,

for I avert my eyes,”

and in the sky he hung a bow

for a sign.

That was once, a pack of years ago,

but the ark is still buried deep in snow,

and there live Sammael and Lilith—man and wife—
grateful for the chill,

Sammael: used by Perets interchangeably with Satan.
Lilith: queen of the demons.
