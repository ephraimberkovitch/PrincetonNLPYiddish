a silver, melting
bit of sky.

I am Job

in the wheel’s shadow;
but often my brief words
end with a question

that drops

from the surprised pen.

A Lecture

A mass of leaves shot through with green and red,
a legend that climbs into lofty windows.

Like the waning sea, the wide street is hushed;

a bus cuts through the violet rain.

Inside the hall, the lecturer analyzes

varieties of literature, the thin autobiographical
veins that run through words.

He drops names that flutter between sentences
like snapshots, like echoes in memory.

Thus, for instance, while taking a walk,

Mendele Moykher Sforim happens in, and wonder
sprinkles from his glasses,

or Glatstein enters, as if at home,

and, wise as light, smiles with his eyes.

They live on the same map.
The places of their stories,
revealed, are cooler now,

Mendele Moykher Sforim and Jacob Glatstein: Mendele (Shalom Jacob Abramo-

vitch, 1835—1917) is acknowledged as one of the classic founders of modern
Yiddish and Hebrew literature, and Jacob Glatstein (1896—1971), Yiddish
poet, is prominently represented in this volume.
