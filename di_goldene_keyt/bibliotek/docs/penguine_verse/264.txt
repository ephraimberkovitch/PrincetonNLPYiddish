Whether he search by night or by day,

no one shall find a trace of our clay.

But if someone should, let his find be poor:
a stubborn back—and nothing more.

Let him stand wondering, mouth agape,
why we fled to a cave for our escape,
what the last words of our distress

in these depths of stoniness.

And let him seek and still not find

if conscience here were undermined,
if the tormented heart grew faint

and blood and courage suffered taint;

If we were tortured by a fiend,

or maybe by someone just and kind;
by ax, by bullet, by lynching herd
or maybe by a casual word.

If he asks our bones mixed one with the other:
Are you the bones of a foe or a brother,

the answer will come: horror struck dumb

and from his own mouth white bubbles of foam.

Long will he stare—not comprehending—
till he turn—eyes bulging, arms extending—
to flee in his fear and consternation

from generation to generation.

The greater his fear, the faster his flight,
running till history flounder in night,
while we go on lying as heretofore:

a stubborn back and nothing more.
