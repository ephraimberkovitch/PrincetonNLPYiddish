The letters in holy books.

Take a candle and light up B’reshis,

Boro, he created.

B’reshis, he created.

Damn it, Nathan, what’s there to think about here?
Let’s go through rain and snow together,

Through frosts and through sunlight,

And let’s sing:

B’reshis, he created worlds.

Just as I tell you about it, that’s how it was—

I’m strolling through the wood and I see the morning rise,

And I see it climbing up crookedly.

The whole creation is pouting mutedly;

And the trees—you should excuse the expression—show me
their rears;

The birds, at my greeting, act as if none of them hears.

A hare turns and sends me the look of a querulous woman,

And, from its pool, the spring water’s saying with venom,

“Never mind, Nakhman. No blessing from you today.”

Their heads lowered, the flowers stink pitifully,

And whatever I think is tangled or heavily rooted,

And all that I say becomes silent, or muted.

So what's to be done, except to make tracks out of there?

What's the use, Nakhman, if all the creation is angry?

But, since I know that the world is compared with a person,
And that all that grows and all that flies,

And even the creepers, poor things, want to be,

I say aloud, as if I weren't joking,

“Well, what is the world?

Something imagined; a delusion;

A transitory moment,

A nonentity, an illusion.”

B’reshis boro: “In the beginning he created’ are the opening words of the
Book of Genesis.
