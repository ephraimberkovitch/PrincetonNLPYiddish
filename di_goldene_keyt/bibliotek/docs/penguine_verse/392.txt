Perets Markish

Ah, generation after generation will come
And go, in bread and salt,

In exhausted vexations,

And will pause, perhaps,

To count and caress their groschens
Beside the extinguished crow-shine

Of the Ark.

And, should sunshine

Ever again be desired,

Then, in the course of a meal
Of worldly radiance,

The outdoors will turn foul;
Thresholds will weep

And, in the midst of the world
A specter will swim into view,
Seratch its back on the sun,
And blaspheme:

“Brothers and sisters, I itch; I stink.”

They take shattered glass and stain it with smoke;
On seaside hills, eyes protrude—
A wonder, a wonder. A miracle. A solar eclipse!

The day’s sun is obscured with blood and pus,
With the cadaverous Mound, with a Babel of corpses.

And the Mound—a filthy cloud—blasphemes:
“Who'll cleanse me for death?

And who will console me?

And out of what deluge

Will a straying Ark

Bring me doves

To this City of Death?”

Ah, wind of the desert,
You will stay faithful to me.
Prometheus, perhaps, will kiss me from a cliff.
