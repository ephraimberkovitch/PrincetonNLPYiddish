And gave a look at the tree up there.

As the first smoke puff went up, I swear,
The crowd—but you'd never hear the same
Even in looney-bins set aflame.

Tar at his heart, the very first spot,

Is black over black, hot over hot,

Each eye not lightning—a soft, white blot.
Body twists skin off, as if trying

Thus to divest itself of dying.

Not only was a rope then flung

And around the neck of the carcass strung,
But other ropes were pulled up high

Causing the Stars and Stripes to fly.

But the sky is blue and doesn’t care,

And the flag’s a joy to the windy air.

And I—whipped dog—watching what occurred,
A partner in crime, said not a word.

You don’t need to swallow a pigsty, I guess,
To vomit up a greenish mess—

Just hear the priest, wisdom’s fount, who says
If Blackness was God’s blunder to begin,
Then letting it mix with white’s a sin.

It’s not the branch, its whining prattle,

Nor the rope, with its dangling rattle,

Nor the windblown feather, that had to miss

Its chance to give the corpse a kiss,

But you—the whole world’s sorrow-stink

Who stood at a distance there to think—
Playing pocket pool, with your fingers curled—
To dream up a poem for yourself and the world.

Now go wake up Chopin, the musician, and let
Him overflow (if he doesn’t forget
How) with tinkling noises, and you can bet,
