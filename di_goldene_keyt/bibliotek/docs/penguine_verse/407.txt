MOYSHE KULBAK

1896, Smorgon, near Vilna—1940, place of death
unknown.

‎near Vilna—Kulbak celebrated the earthiness and‏ שיט
‎vitality of Jews of the soil. He also captured the unsettling excite-‏
‎ment of the cities that were being transformed by war, industrial‏
‎development, and revolution, and during a sojourn in Berlin‏
‎was exposed to expressionist trends in literature and‏ ,)1920—23(
‎art. He then settled in Vilna, where he became a popular teacher of‏
‎literature in the Teachers’ Seminary. Anticipating more liberal‏
‎cultural and political conditions for Jewish writers in the Soviet‏
‎Union, he went to Minsk in 1928. His major ‘Soviet’ work, the‏
‎novel Zelmenyaner, an often comic and grotesque chronicle of‏
‎Jewish adaptation to communism, is one of the masterpieces of‏
‎Yiddish prose. He was arrested in 1937, following criticism of his‏
‎“reactionary” tendencies, and perished in a labor camp.‏

‎Kulbak’s poetry enjoys great rhythmic variation: the staccato
throb of “A Ball’; the long-breathed luxuriance of Byelorussia; the
reverential power of the great ode in “Vilna.” His ability to straddle
the old and the new—the residual impact of the religious tradition
and the robust attractions of the modern idiom—influenced such
younger Vilna poets as Chaim Grade, Leyzer Volf, and Abraham
Sutzkever.
