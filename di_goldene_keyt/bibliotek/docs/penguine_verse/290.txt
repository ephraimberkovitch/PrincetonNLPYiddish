City
City!

You called me from afar

With your droning wire.

I saw you always on a height!
You drew me with glittering,
Gleaming tongs.

You deceived me

And you ensnared me.

You pierced, and you split

And you splintered

The calm of my village chamber
With the whistling of trains

And train-track vibrations.

And always, on high, there hung
Your restless, enchanting sounds.
City!

You ensnared me.

Before my eyes,

Long dazzled by woods and fields,

Your mighty stone body now lies;

Pipes rooted deep in the earth,

Arms outflung;

Heaped up, many storeyed,

Chambered and checkered;

Dark at the base and sparkling on high,
Towered with blades and pointed with chimneys,
Knotted and girdled

With serpentine train tracks,

Braided and curtained

With cobwebs of wire.

City!

You ensnared me.

City!
I arrived in your harbor
On the ship of my loneliness.
