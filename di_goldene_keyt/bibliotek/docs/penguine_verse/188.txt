20 Yisroel-Yankev Schwartz

 

And I remember Yehoash in 1907,

shining with refinement,

old wisdom, and young faith;

and Rosenfeld in 1909

in Clairmont Park, the Bronx, under a tree,
angered, broken by life;

and Liessen, the man of struggle and song,

Jewish in his stubbornness,

and devotion of his life and soul,

a challenge to the hostile world—

a great, strong generation, rooted

in earth soaked in our blood

and with heads thrust up toward heaven.

Directly after, a great chorus,

a band of the young, joined them

in the great stream flowing here in all the ships
that carried the host of refugees to this free shore—
along with the poverty of the old home

each ship brought its rich tribute to Yiddish poetry.
They came in search—not of gold or worldly goods—
but like those who came before, wanting, searching only for
the poem burning on their lips,

flaming in their eyes and hearts.

And each of them in his own form,

with his own voice. A young generation,

new growth in an old field,

came up overnight with sound,

with rustling branches and fruit.

Some of them fell on the heavy way

at the height of blossom: Moyshe-Leyb,

as I see him now in those young years

before his head had turned ash-gray.

A young tough with a red face—

freckled—

our street musician in this land,

clashing the cymbals till he died.

And Zishe’s genteel figure of those days.

A delicate, supple shoot come up

“from a kingdom not of this world,”
