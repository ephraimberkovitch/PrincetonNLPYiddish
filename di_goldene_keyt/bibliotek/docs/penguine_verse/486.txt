Glatstein wrote many poems directed to God, particularly after the Sec-
ond World War, transposing His traditional attributes into homely
human terms. This poem recalls the special bond created between God
and the Jews through the granting of the Law at Sinai. It notes that the
Jewish success in spreading the idea of a universal God, first through
Christianity and Islam, then through secular messianism of modern
political movements, benefited neither the Jews nor the God whose mes-
sengers they presumed to be.

Genesis

Why don’t we start all over again

with a small people,

out of the cradle and little?

The two of us, wanderers over the nations.
Tillers of the soil will bow before You.
You'll live on burnt offerings of grain.

I'll go around preaching folk wisdom;

it won’t reach past our borders,

but the least little child will greet me

good morning.

Why don’t we both go home and start over,
from the very beginning,
out of our littleness?

Almighty Yahweh, who hast waxed great
over the seven firmaments and continents,
swollen steel-strong in vast churches

and synagogues, God of the Universe!
You've deserted field and barn;

I, the close love of my people.

We've both turned universal.

Come back, dear God, to a land no bigger than a speck.
Dwindle down to only ours.

Y’'ll go around with homely sayings
suitable for chewing over in small places.
We'll both be provincial,

God and His poet.

Maybe it will go sweeter for us.
