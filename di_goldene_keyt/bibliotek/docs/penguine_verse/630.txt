602. Aba Shtoltsenberg

Bolsheviks

They came on ponies, barefoot,
brandishing guns that had no bullets;
wore ladies’ hats backwards; their leaders
with the look of deacons; and packs

of ox-men, heads wrapped in sacks.

They came in early autumn, shook down
the pears they could not pick by hand;
sprawled across sidewalks and church steps
and felt themselves masters of the land.

The motorcycles spring out of nowhere.
A blast from the roaring White Guards!
Of Trotsky’s soldiers nothing remains here
but some sad little mounds near the woods.

Stanley Kunitz

Boring Days -

I made a way through fire and big winds
and bullets and tipsy song.

Over the frontier and past strict guards

till 1 walked into the swamp of boring days.
Boring days; the spider weaves, the cricket saws,
fear molelike burrows,

as in a dripping rain forest

I stand in wall space, in the blind city-wheel,
and attend—mice rustle, spade scrapes,

I could be stuck to the floor.

Old letters sob

and all I’ve lived is cobwebbed.

Sky and tree a dusty picture

mounted in a window frame.

Boring days; beneath your weight

horses fall, dogs go mad.
