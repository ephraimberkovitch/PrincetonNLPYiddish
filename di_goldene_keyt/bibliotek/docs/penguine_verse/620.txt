I'll not kiss your dust as that great poet did,

Though my heart, like his, is filled with song and grief.
How can I kiss your dust? I am your dust.

And how, I ask you, can I kiss myself?

Still dressed in my shabby clothes

Vll stand and gape at the blue Kinneret

Like a roving prince who has found his blue
Though blue was in his dream when he first started.

I'll not kiss your blue, I’ll merely stand
Silent as a Shimenesre prayer myself.

How can I kiss your blue.? I am your blue.
And how, I ask you, can I kiss myself?

Musing, I'll stand before your great desert,
And hear the camels’ ancient tread as they
Sway with trade and Torah on their humps.
I'll hear the age-old hovering wander-song
That trembles over glowing sand and dies,
And then recalls itself and does not disappear.
I'll not kiss your sand. No, and ten times no.
How can I kiss your sand? I am your sand.
And how, I ask you, can I kiss myself?

Leonard Wolf

Shimenesre: Yiddish for the Amidah prayer that originally consisted of
eighteen (shmone esrey, Hebrew) blessings.
