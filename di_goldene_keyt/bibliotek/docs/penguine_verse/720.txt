Poetry

 

A dark violet plum,

the last one on the tree,

thin-skinned and delicate as the pupil of an eye,
that in the dew at night blots out

love, visions, shivering,

and then at the morning star the dew

grows weightless: That

is poetry. Touch it so lightly

that you don’t leave a fingerprint.

1954 Chana Bloch

Toys

My daughter, you must care for your toys,
Poor things, they’re even smaller than you.
Every night, when the fire goes to sleep,
Cover them with the stars of the tree.

Let the golden pony graze

The cloudy sweetness of the field.
Lace up the little boy’s boots
When the sea-eagle blows cold.

Tie a straw hat on your doll
And put a bell in her hand.
For not one of them has a mother,
And so they cry out to God.

Love them, your little princesses—

I remember a cursed night

When there were dolls left in all seven streets
OF the city. And not one child.
