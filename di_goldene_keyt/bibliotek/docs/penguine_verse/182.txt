and on the pine floor

in a flood of sunlight,

the gold and green swaying shadows

of the pointed leaves

of heavy old oaks and young oaks.

It was hard for Josh to tear himself away
from the great secret filling him

like overwhelming wine;

and looking at the wide expanse,

the old verse would come to mind:
“God hath spread us abroad,

and we will be established in the land.”
