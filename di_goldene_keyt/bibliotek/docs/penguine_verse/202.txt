Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

Memento Mori

And if Moyshe-Leyb, Poet, recounted how

He’s glimpsed Death in the breaking waves, the way
You catch that sight of yourself in the mirror

At about 10 A.M. on some actual day,

Who would be able to believe Moyshe-Leybl?

And if Moyshe-Leyb greeted Death from afar,

With a wave of his hand, asking, “Things all right?”
At the moment when many a thousand people

Lived there in the water, wild with delight,

Who would be able to believe Moyshe-Leybl?

And if Moyshe-Leyb were to swear

That he was drawn to Death in the way

An exiled lover is to the casement

Of his worshipped one, at the end of the day,
Who would be able to believe Moyshe-Leybl?

And if Moyshe-Leyb were to paint them Death
Not gray, dark, but color-drenched, as it shone
Ataround 10 A.M. there, distantly,

Between the sky and the breakers, alone,

Who would be able to believe Moyshe-Leybl?
