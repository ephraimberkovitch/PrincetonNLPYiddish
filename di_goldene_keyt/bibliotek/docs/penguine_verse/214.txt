 

Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

The devil runs into the village then

With the Miracle of the Reddened Bread,
But Abramka can tell he’s a devil who wants
To torture the goyim till they’re dead

With the tale of a Miracle. .

So he pushes his way to the front of the crowd
And says that they’re bored with tales so absurd;
But the devil laughs, and pointing upward

As if at some suddenly passing bird,

He cuts Abramka’s throat.

The goyim think this is a riot, and laugh

With their faces turned upward toward the sun,
And the devil proceeds to have with them

The same variety of fun

He had with poor Abramka.

The goyim lie in the golden sunset

Like red loaves of bread along the ground;
The crows say Grace to their Provider—
As they come gathering around—

For such a splendid banquet.

The devil runs back to the windmill then
And dances like a monkey, and springs

From sail to sail in the golden sunset

And crows like a cock, and whistles and sings
Like the silly wind at its labors.

John Hollander

From One of My Letters

Verily, I am far away from you...

But in your letters, gentle things you do
Recall whole companies of summer birds
Seeking flower-honey in among nettles.
