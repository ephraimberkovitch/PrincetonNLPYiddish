 

Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

I shall be reading always the riddle of the dead,
Death’s sickle flashing up in front of me in red
Fire. Like red fire.

Like gold.

Like blood.

John Hollander

180

Halpern’s second book of poetry was called Di goldene pave (The Golden
Peacock, 1924) after the beauteous legendary bird of the Yiddish folk
song. “The Bird” mocks the romantic expectations that the book’s title

elicits. The expression “He's a strange bird” is as common in Yiddish as in
English,

The Bird

So this bird comes, and under his wing is a crutch,
And he asks why I keep my door on the latch;

So I tell him that right outside the gate

Many robbers watch and wait

To get at the hidden bit of cheese,

Under my ass, behind my knees.

Then through the keyhole and the crack in the jamb
The bird bawls out he’s my brother Sam,

And tells me I’ll never begin to believe

How sorely he was made to grieve

On shipboard, where he had to ride

Out on deck, he says, from the other side.

So I get a whiff of what's in the air,
And leave the bird just standing there.
Meanwhile—because one never knows,
I mean—I’m keeping on my toes,
Further pushing my bit of cheese
Under my ass and toward my knees.
