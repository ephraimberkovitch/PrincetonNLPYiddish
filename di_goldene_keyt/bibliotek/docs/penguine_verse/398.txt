370 Perets Markish

Why do I need the Sabbath with its pots and blessing candles?
Night, at the head of its bed, sets its lanterns out,

There, funereal horses stitch out my black shirt.

Make way, droplets of the sea—for one more drop.

Me

”

:

The marketplace sleeps, its booths like skulls.
Lamps, like doves, come into its dreams.
Then why is the Sabbath still here

On my dusty feet?

Enamored winds come to spend the night,
Their wings spread in blessing,

Then why don’t the candles light up

On my work-a-day hands?

Will nobody come in a dream?
Or ever be greeted again?

Has anyone straying out there
Encountered my radiant Sabbath?

1922 Leonard Wolf
