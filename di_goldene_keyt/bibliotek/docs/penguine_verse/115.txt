ABRAHAM REISEN

(Avrom Reyzn) 1876, Keidany, White Russia—
1953, New York.

 

R Jew who wrote Hebrew and Yiddish verse—Reisen began to
write poetry when he was nine and to publish at fifteen. He read
widely in Jewish and European literature, absorbing many in-
fluences, but his light, ironic stories and poems seemed the spon-
taneous expression of a simple Jew. Set to music, many of his
verses became popular as folk songs.

Reisen was one of the most prolific and energetic of Yiddish
poets and writers. In Warsaw (1900-1910, with some interrup-
tions), he contributed to many Yiddish newspapers, published his
first book, Stories and Sketches (1903), and edited a number of
periodicals. He was equally productive during his first sojourn in
America (1911—1913) and following his move there after the out-
break of the First World War. Though he was a Yiddishist and
Socialist, his sympathies for the suffering poor were more instinc-
tive than political; the many publications he edited placed greater
emphasis on literary culture than on social action. He also wrote
several important volumes of memoirs.
