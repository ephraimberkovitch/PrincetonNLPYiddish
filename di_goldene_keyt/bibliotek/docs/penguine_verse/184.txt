This elegy recalls the beginnings of Yiddish culture on New York's Lower
East Side; it evokes many of its legendary figures. Those of the first
generation include Eliakum Zunser (1836—1913), a famous Yiddish folk
poet who established a small printing shop that became a meeting place
for writers; Yehoash (Solomon Bloomgarten, 1872—1927), translator of
the Bible into Yiddish; Morris Rosenfeld (1862-1923); and Abraham
Liessin (1872—1938), longtime editor of the influential magazine Zukunft
and a well-received poet. Of his younger colleagues, Schwartz mentions
Moyshe-Leyb Halpern (1886--1932); Zishe Landau (1889-1937); and
Avrom-Moyshe Dilon (1883-1934), a less successful writer who was
described as having moved through life “like an unpublished poem.”

In the End-of-Summer Light

My heart, my tired heart, sings elegies

in the clear end-of-summer light.

All the allure and pain of withering hangs in the air
over the park, over the grass and trees.

The sky is blue, deep blue;

the sun burns bright in the blue expanse.

My face turned sunward, eyes half shut,

I sit and drink that good caressing warmth.

The trees rain yellow leaves unendingly, unceasing.
Bees hum, birds twitter in the branches.

On this still, bright day

that passes with so much peace,

an old song hums in my head and in my quiet heart
like a dove cooing in a ruin,

a song I knew and long ago forgot.

It wakes and stays with me and moves me to tears.

I walk in woods I never knew,

the sunlight doesn’t warm me here.

I sing—my song

is hushed, my singing has no echo here.

Oh, clear light of our autumn days—
I’ve lived your beauty forty years,
and still the heart can’t rejoice
