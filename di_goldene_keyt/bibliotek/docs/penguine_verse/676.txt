Winter Song

Oh, what a pleasure to sing winter songs in khamsin days,

while the sun sleeps like an old man on a dead wind.

Go, gather up the members of your household,

especially your young little Sabras—

and sing, sing for them

the lovely song of fragrant snow.

Truly, I remember the smell of the first snow in my
grandfather's orchards:

it smells of gooseberries and of the naked calves of the
tenant’s daughter

when she comes striding out of the river and her skin burns
hard and cold.

I used to watch her by the river through the branches
of the trees... .

I can still remember the smell of the first snowman I made

near my grandfather's stable, I remember the smell of his
snow-body:

he smelled like Eve, the first Adam’s wife,

when she stepped like a little aristocrat up to the tree
of knowledge. .

Later I kneaded all these smells of snow into my song.

Truly, my song has become a spice-box, it holds

all the spicy smells of once-upon-a-time.

I remember: wearing sheepskins and wild caps, like Huculs,

the village Jews fly on sleds to the wintry forest,

and beneath the black horses the white frost

plays a lively folk tune on moon-fiddles.

I’m sitting with them and my nostrils

can smell out the winter-king’s palaces, polished as frozen glass,

palaces that hang shining among the marble cliffs.

At night the miller’s enchanted daughters dance, all seven brides
of Ashmodi’s own personal apprentices.

khamsin: sirocco, heat wave.
Huculs: name of Ukrainian peasants in southeastern Galicia.
Ashmodi (Asmodeus): according to talmudic legend, the king of the demons.
