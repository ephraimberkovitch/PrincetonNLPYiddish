158 Yisroel-Yankev Schwartz

or eye be gratified enough

by the grace of tints and colors

and mild, clear light that pours out so much peace.
(God grant that peace not be taken from us

or our children or all this land.)

Like red beads, the clusters of raspberries

shine through the yellow-green branches,

white smoke rises

from piles of burning leaves,

and when the mild breeze blows,

the sharp scent of burning leaves

finds me here on this sequestered bench,

the tart and bitter smell of sap and grass

dried and yellowed in flame.

And through the curtain of smoke

the chattering of children

vaguely reaches me as if it came from another world.
The sharp smoke makes my senses drunk,

and in my heart trembles, trembles, sings:

 

I walk in woods I never knew,

the sunlight doesn’t warm me here.

I sing—my song

is hushed, my singing has no echo here.

A half hour’s walk from the hill where I sit

is the field of great peace,

shaded by trees, covered with grass—

in the elegaic light of this day

our time of building-up and strength

in a new land rises up; a great forest,

a green rustling growing forest full of bird song.
With pity and grace that time is engraved in my heart.
And I remember Eliakum, the old bard,

sitting in his print shop

on East Broadway on hot summer days,

nodding off in his chair.

(Ivconfess I never read his poems,

recall them from my mother’s lips.)
