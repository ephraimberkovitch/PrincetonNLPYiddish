at something far away.

“What's wrong with you, Monish?” says his friend.
“Tell me.”

His mother sees him pining away:
“What's wrong, my child?

What wind put out

the light in your eyes,

my bright havdole candles?

Why are all the tunes you sing
lamenting?

“You used to sing other things.
My heart would laugh

When you sang with the cantor
or at the Sabbath meal,

free as a bird, clear as a bell.
And now there’s something else.
What is it, child? Tell me!

It frightens me!”

“Do I know, Momma, what song

is singing in me?

It's not that I want to sing;

it sings itself.

The sounds rise like birds

from the nest,

and these are the songs they bring me.”

Now from olden days

there was a ruin in that place—

(I won’t attempt to say

whether church or castle;

let that much remain in doubt,

I can tell you only what I’ve read about it.)
