“Let me out,” I plead, “don’t be a louse,”
And he answers, ‘Let me in the house.”

But I know what he wants. So I bide

My time and let him wait outside.

He inquires about the bit of cheese

Under my ass, behind my knees;

Scared, I reach down, but, yes, it’s still here.
T haven't the slightest thing to fear.

John Hollander

Halpern here offers his own version of the Christian sacrament, as he
elsewhere parodies Jewish ritual.

The Tale of the Fly

On a windmill sail, in the golden sunset,

Sits a devil who whines with vexation,

For a fly has escaped from the starving village
And she buzzes and circles around his nose,
Never letting him sleep.

The miller hears, at his idle wheel,

Whining (but whose?) from outside somewhere;
He thinks it must be his wife, who comes

To ask why he sits there like a bear,

Not grinding bread for the children.

So he starts the idle millstones turning
And jumps between them—as if instead
Of wheat; the sun peers in and thinks
That her shining has made the flour red,
So she shows the devil this Wonder.
