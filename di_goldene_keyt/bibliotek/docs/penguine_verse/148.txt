The Lion and the Mouse

Caught in a net, a desperate, thrashing lion,
Encircled, tangled, muted thunder,

Fallen.

Ah, passerby, do not pass by

Such grief indifferently.

Comes now the mouse, afraid of drawing near,
She says,

“Poor fellow. It’s a wonder

Not to be believed.

Lion and mouse—so long as we both live
We have our share of grief.

Woe’s

Me. Oh, woe.

So that’s a lion?

Run, bunny, run.

Go call the cat who only yesterday
Gulped my brother

And my brother-in-law

Down.

Call her, call and say,

‘See, cat, see. See the lion,

Who, where he set his foot,

Made the whole earth tremble.

Now come and see and draw a moral.’
With the lion’s fate before her eye,
Whatever will the cat reply?

“Now, if the net were rope—
Ah, that would be

Another matter.

I'd quickly turn it to a thing

OF shreds and tatters.

But steel! A net of steel. Oh, my!

What sort of mouse heroics can a mouse display?

Ah, there’s ill luck even for a mouse’s tooth,
And that’s the truth.
