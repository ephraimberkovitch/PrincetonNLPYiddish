DOVID HOFSHTEYN

1889, Korostyshev, Ukraine—1952, place of death
unknown.

H recognition as one of the finest Yiddish lyrical poets in the
Soviet Union. His verse evoked the sweet cadences of bygone life
but also caught the tempo of modern unrest. Raised in a village, in
1907 he went to Kiev to study and after the Revolution formed part
of the literary circle around the publication Eygns, which balanced
revolutionary priorities with Jewish national themes. He left the
Soviet Union for Berlin in 1924, when his protest against the Soviet
anti-Hebrew campaign elicited sharp attacks upon him. In 1925 he
went to Palestine, but he returned to the Soviet Union and repented
of his “nationalistic’ tendencies. Despite his difficulties in com-
plying with the ideological directives from the late 1920s onward,
Hofshteyn remained prolific throughout the 1930s and the wartime
period. He was arrested in 1948 and executed on August 12, 1952.
