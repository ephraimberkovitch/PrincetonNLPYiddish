The rain is yours.
I have been through my rainstorms.

Gather me up
like wheat.

Marcia Falk

Love drained me pale
and I became still
and I became thin
and weightless.

Flesh toppled me over
and I became swollen,
thick and heavy

with passion.

God, where are you not!
Even in the unclean fires of hell
I see the shadows of your lashes.

And flesh is a golem,
staring, dumb,

and when it cries,
what a pity,

what a desolate pity.

Marcia Falk

Last Apple

“T am like the last apple
that falls from the tree
and no one picks up.”
