292 Uri Tsvi Greenberg

“Once my Messiah-body gave off the fragrance of balm; now it

throws off the smell of a body rotting

alive! a horror as if encrusted with the heads of pins!

Thad set aflame like forests the sorrows of generations. In the Slav
lands

all the Jews celebrated—in sable hats and silken coats made
pilgrimages to Turkey.

And those who didn’t go—their eyes followed after,

followed those privileged to go to the King Messiah, he who would
soon take over

the Turkish crown. And every night Jews dreamed

that the great hurts, the great needs, like little fish were swimming
in clear streams of joy;

that figs were growing, dates were growing, and breads as well,
breads, too;

that the mountains were all dissolving; that there were lying on
either side the world-path

radiant stones, all gold!’

But the Jews’ dark destiny did not wish it so.

There waited instead for Shabtai Tsvi a Turkish fez with a tassel—

and when Shabtai Tsvi-Mohammed-Effendi died, and the Moslems

buried him as their rituals required,

not one Jew tore his jacket cloth, or the cloth of the Ark in
mourning.

The very opposite! Oh, Jews, rejoice, rejoice! Satan is his mourner!

Nor did the Jews inquire among the Moslems

regarding the blue-brown bruises everywhere upon him,

because, when he had been called throughout his days and nights
Mohammed and Effendi,

his hands had pinched like dough the flesh of his body.

Once more among the Jews every table has grown sad.

Once more—anxiety and anguish, like a sea with its fish;

and curses and prayers in the morning and curses and prayers at
night.

And thirsty cattle once more by the closed well-mouth.
