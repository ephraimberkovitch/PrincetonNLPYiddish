MORRIS
ROSENFELD

1862, Suwalki region, Poland—1923, New York.

ollowing his immigration to London, and then to New York in

1886, Rosenfeld worked as a tailor in clothing factories.
His poetry expressed the bitterness of sweatshop conditions and its
effect on the softer ranges of human feeling. The first Yiddish poet
to gain international fame, through his translated Songs of the
Ghetto, he was rewarded by work in the daily Yiddish press, but
this required, as he said, “service to the pen that had once served
him.” While younger Yiddish poets rebelled against the social and
national stridency of his verse, some of them also acknowledged
their debt to his lyricism, which showed the potential of Yiddish as
a literary language.
