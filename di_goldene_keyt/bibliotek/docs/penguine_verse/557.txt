IZ] KHARIK

1898, Zembin, White Russia—1937, place of death
unknown.

s a youthful supporter of the Revolution, Kharik joined the

Red Army in 1919 and fought in the Civil War. He played a
leading part in the expansion of Yiddish cultural activity in the
Soviet Union, becoming one of the members of the executive of the
White Russian Communist Party in Minsk, and a leading figure in
the educational and cultural organizations of the region. One of the
boldest representatives of Soviet Yiddish “Proletarian’” verse, he
retained a wry affection for the shtetl traditionalism he saw declin-
ing. In 1937 he was arrested by the Soviet regime. He died several
months later in prison.
