a soft warm dew starts
to melt through our limbs.

And when we remember home,
Mir is mine, his Rishkan,

I’m no longer a little bit right
and he’s not left anymore.

My father owned a flour mill,
his father, horses and wagons.
Our wheel turned in the water
and his ran over the earth.

We talk of Sabbath and weekdays,
about all kinds of foods,

what we prepared for the holidays,
what they were cooking in Rishkan.

We talk like old, good friends,

we speak from the heart and honestly—
though he is left through and through
and I just a bit on the right.

Home from Praying

The air was always damp and cool

when we hurried from the house.

The sun beat on the mill roof,

but shadow still slept in the lanes.

In our Sabbath best, our cuffs rolled up,

we walked, away from the roads and over the fields
to the next village, the Jewish estate there,

to gather for holiday services.

And stumps of trees spread_across

the meadows and tripped our feet,

Mir: in Minsk province, Russia; Rishkan (Ryshkany) is in Moldavia.
