192 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

 

Same girls keep changing their own clothes?
Change away, my child.

But one thing, child, I have to say:

If once ambition leads you to try

To make some kind of big display

Of yourself with what’s hanging up there in the sky;
If you dare (but may that time not come soon!)
To write about moonlight and the moon,

Or some poem of the Bible, poisoning the world,
Then, my dear,

If I’m worth something then by way of any
Money, so much as a single penny,

I'll make my will, leaving everything

To my landsman, the future Polish king.

Though we've both stopped calling each other “thou,”
I'll chop up, like a miser shredding

Cake for beggars at a wedding,

All the ties that bind us now:

Poppa-chopper Son-schmon

And so help me God in Heaven

This

Will

Be

Done.

 

John Hollander

The future Polish king: According to Jewish legend, Saul ben Judah Wahl
(1541—c. 1617), a leading figure of Lithuanian Jewry, became king of Poland
for a single day. In eastern Europe, the provisions for the poor at wedding
feasts were a test of generosity.
