316 Melech Ravitch

And tears from his eyes kept flowing
and all delight was drowned,

for on continent and ocean

the world was not to be found.

For on continent and ocean,
wherever he was blown,
the king, the singer, always
found himself alone.

From continent and ocean,

he returned to his piece of earth,
asking his old mother

why she had given him birth.

And his mother lamenting,
while tears ran down her face,
locked the king, the singer,
like a child in her embrace.

(The lamp began to flicker,

its glass shade turning black . . .)

I had to give birth to you, my child,
so that death would take you back.

Once there was a story.

Hardly happy, it could not sing,
and the story had its beginning
with a Jewish singer, a king.‚Äù
