HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

1 have weighed the competing claims of enlightenment and enter-
tainment, consistency and common sense. One reader may use this
anthology to study the development of modern Yiddish poetry;
another will open it at random to enjoy a poet or a poem. We have
tried to structure the book so that it will be agreeable to both kinds
of readers.

The poets appear in chronological order, and as far as possible
we have also tried to present the poems of each author in the order
in which they were published. This arrangement has the advantage
of showing the way Yiddish poets of different continents and
countries influenced one another, but it also means that poets
linked together in literary or geographical units—like Di Yunge in
the United States or the Yung Vilne group of the 1930s—now
stand independently, in accordance with the dates of birth. The in-
troduction and the biographical notes should alert the reader to the
necessary historical associations.

All historical and critical material dealing with individual poets
is to be found within the section presenting the poet’s work. A
brief biographical sketch opens each section. This is followed by
the Yiddish texts and English translations, roughly aligned. Oc-
casionally, a historical or critical note on an individual poem,
intended to help readers with unfamiliar contexts or references, ap-
pears as a headnote over the English translation. Notes explaining
unfamiliar customs or terms appear at the foot of the page of the
English translation. Finally, bibliographical materials can be found
at the back of the book. The bibliography provides dates of
publication whenever these are available. When poets dated their
works, the date appears at the bottom of the text.

The problem of transliterating Yiddish names and words is a
troubling one. At the risk of inconsistency we have used a mixed
approach. The names of poets who wrote mainly in Europe or who
