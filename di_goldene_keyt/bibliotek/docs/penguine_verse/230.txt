But perhaps it’s only a miracle

That I look like a treasure hunter still
Walking around with my lowered head:
The truth is, I’m really one of the dead
Belatedly leaving the synagogue

And hurrying toward his grave. My God.

John Hollander

Based on biographical fact, the poem summons up the image of the
poet's brother, who died in infancy. The holiday Purim, commemorating
the political triumph of the Jews over their enemy, Haman, is traditionally
celebrated by masquerades and festivals. This poem and the two
preceding it form part of a cycle called “Shtotgortn.”

 

O, Shmuel My Brother!

A topper’s a splendid kind of hat

And the red rose is splendid too;

But the Haman in the Purim plays

Gets smeared more than the others do

With makeup—then, quickly whisked offstage,
He’s the first one through.

O Shmuel, my four-year-younger brother,
On Purim you died, on the very day;
There by Grandpa Israel, and other Jews,
You've lain at peace in the welcoming clay
