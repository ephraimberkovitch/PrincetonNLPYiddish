Future Generations

Future generations,
Brothers still to come,
Don’t you dare

Be scornful of our songs.
Songs about the weak,
Songs of the exhausted

In a poor generation,
Before the world’s decline.

We were all imbued

With the idea of freedom,

Yet sang our songs about it
With voices lowered.

Far from our good fortune

We met at night, in darkness,
And worked at building bridges
In secrecy.

We hid from the foes
Who lay in wait for us,
And this is why our songs
Resonate with grief,

And why our melodies
Have a dismal longing
And a hidden rage

In their warp and woof.
