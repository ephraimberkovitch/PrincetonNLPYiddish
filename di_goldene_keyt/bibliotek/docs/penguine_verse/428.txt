Eternally wet; and always a lash at your shoulders;
Smelling of fish scales, and smells of the scum of the river,
Blessed shall you be on the shore,

And blessed on the water.”

 

It was evening; the glimmer of red at the window
Cast in the darkness, a tinge of light on my grandpa;
My uncles were still; and silent, too, was my father.
And caught every word of his blessing.

Then Grandfather said his goodbyes and gathered his limbs
together;

He closed his wide eyes one more time, now and forever.

The watchers looked on and regarded his muted body;

There was nothing to see; and no tear was shed by my uncles.

A bird in the forest sang to the night of its sorrows;

The last bit of torch in the hut still gleamed in its socket.

My uncles formed a small band round my grandfather’s pillow,
Their heavy, their shaggy heads drooped on their shoulders.

In the world, but that it gets on without him.

He sings the wretched song of gray and poor. He weeps
And stretches his long frame higher and higher.
