558 Yisroel Rabon

And when midnight comes upon the world, a yowling will begin
rising from the cat encampment, loud cries of distress.

That will be the sorrow, brother, weeping deep in me,
escaping from the prison house of my loneliness.

I’m leaving for Leutamirsk today, and by tomorrow night,
I'll be drifting through some village or sleeping in some byre;
or telling peasants stories by the half-light of the moon

as I warm my weary body by a friendly peat fire.

Mendacious Song

My grandfather lived five thousand years or so
and he slept on a baking griddle.

Grass grew on his head

and his hair made music as if it were a fiddle.

And once my grandfather slapped the moon’s teeth out
because she was stingy and left the world half-lit.

And because he wanted the sun for his very own,

he paid the Lord Almighty a mint for it.

And when he spoke with his dogs, it was Yiddish that he spoke,
and those who overheard him glowed with pride.

And when he told a story or a joke,

people toppled over laughing and nearly died.

For lunch my grandfather would eat a cloud or two
garnished with carrots and fried.

Afterward he would unbutton his pants and roar,
still unsatisfied.

And when, God bless him, Grandfather kissed a woman
in one of his sudden pashes,

she burst into flames that nobody could put out

and fell dead at his feet, burned to ashes.
