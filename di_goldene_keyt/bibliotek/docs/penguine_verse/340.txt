312 Melech Ravitch

where from the kitchen they can see
the graveyard far away.

And my nightmares toss in a dance

of delirium and dread,

and suddenly, sharp, like a lightning flash
the notion enters my head

that the seven continents are dreams,
and dreams the seven seas,

and my forty-two years as well
mere fantasies.

Momma smiles. Poppa breaks into laughter:
“Though continent and sea

may appear mere dreams to you,

Our home is reality.

From one side of the house
you can see a hill and a train,
and always from the other side
the graveyard, sun or rain.

There our forefathers lie,

four generations or more.

We must rest, we must rest, my son,
after forty-two years are done

after tropics and Singapore.”’

Momma says, “You really believe—

I can read it clear in your face—

that the world out there is something more
than our little marketplace.

Well, out through the window go
your continents, if you please,
and into the kitchen pail

I pour your seven seas.
