Belzhets was used by the Nazis during the Second World War as the site
of a forced labor camp and, from March 1942, as an extermination center
where some 600,000 Jews, many of them from the immediate area, were
gassed. The poem evokes an imagined trial conducted by three famous
Hasidic rabbis of the region whose kindness and reputation for charitable
deeds had won them the title Lovers of Israel.”

The “Lovers of Israel’
at the Belzhets Death Camp

Reb Moyshe Leyb of Sossov points to the heaps of ash
(The storm is but recently weathered).

His beard trembles; his body and life are embittered:
“See, Lord. Ah, take a good look,” he says.

“Listen, gentlemen, listen,” Reb Volf of Zborosh murmurs;
His voice, like an evening fiddle, is tired—

“The Lord above has not looked well to his vineyard. .. .
Proof: These heaps abandoned on earth.”

Trembling and feverish, Reb Meirl of Przemyslan
Waits, leaning on his old stick. ““Gentlemen,”
He says, “Let us in unison call

To God, ‘Creator of worlds, Thou art mighty and great,
But we Galician Jews forever erase
Your name from the list of true Lovers of Israel.
