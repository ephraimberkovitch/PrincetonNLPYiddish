 

204 Moyshe-Leyb Halpern

For thirty-five years now; but I’Il lie here,
Across the sea somewhere, far away.

A red lucky mark still on your forehead,
The light of the world first dawned for you,
And then, on the eighth day you died:

Your mohel was your Death Angel, too.
When you think about it, how hard to know
If things must happen as they do. . .

 

If you were still here, we'd be shuffling together
And hushing ourselves deep into the snow;

And perhaps someone seeing our woolly caps

And our boots, and our scarves that looked just so,
Would have us in to tell her something

Of home—with a hot glass of tea below.

So the two of us, for the love of her
Across from us there in a house of gold
Would tell of a host of murdered children
To a chant deeply sorrowful, and old;
Perhaps then she would cry out, pleading
That some other kind of tale be told.

So the two of us, well-mannered now, like princes
Would sink before her on bended knee;

And implore her: could she not get us jobs

In some nightclub in the vicinity

To sing the good old songs for folks

Who sit there with women as gorgeous as she?

And perhaps, when she hears the way we talk,
She'll have us immediately enrolled

As her very own footmen; and then because
She wants all her visitors to behold

Us as princes, we're dressed in fine gold jackets,
And golden trousers, and shoes of gold.

mohel: performs the circumcision of a Jewish boy, normally on the eighth day
after birth.
