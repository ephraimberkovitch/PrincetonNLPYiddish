598 Aba Shtoltsenberg

Wolf Bezberider

Among bailiffs and creditors

Wolf Bezberider is free-handed.

They stagger off with silver trays,

the mizrekh from his wall,

iron bedsteads, kitchen copper.

He walks in empty rooms:

You ease me of a weight, God,

and take off my blindfold.

My sight’s unblurred as after a downpour.
If youre with me

Vl walk dry through it

and outlive hunger years. .

He gives a pauper his silk wardrobe.
Rough jacket and coarse linen suit the road.
He abandons house and town with a heart
as though he’d lost nothing.

I was born naked

and can praise you at any corner,

shoeless and with a torn shirt, God,

and at strange tables.

Bad at the bourse.

Shares at mud level.

Banks bleed,

the merchant throws himself under a train.
Bankrupt Jews abandon the world.

All treasuries hang by a hair.

mizrekh: a plaque or decoration placed on the east (Heb. mizrakh) wall of
a room to indicate the direction of Jerusalem.
