628 Leyzer Volf

I know that your lot has worsened,

that you drown in streams of blood.

But what does that show, dear brethren?
That I also don’t have it good.

Though I do not lack—God forbid it!—
fish or meat or wine.

May never the poorest cantor

have less on which to dine.

Oh, my miserable brethren,

it is for you I pray,

whom everyone tramples and slaughters
in the north and south each day.

I go to duke and baron.

When I speak, they can’t refuse.
‘Why are you distressing

my good fellow Jews?

Pogroms? What do they bring you?
Three things: blood and blood

and a very bad reputation.

You'd do better to do them good.

What do you think’s the answer?’
‘It’s hard for us and we err,

but we'll really make an effort

to do better by you, sir!’

There at the theater

I'm sitting with the most
illustrious of the nobles

and two princelings, not to boast,

and with a voice as sweet as honey
I quietly give my views:

‘Why is the regime, Your Highness,
so much harder on the Jews?’
