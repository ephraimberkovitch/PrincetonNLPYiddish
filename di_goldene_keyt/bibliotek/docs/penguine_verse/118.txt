To a Woman Socialist

Your eyes glisten, glow, and sparkle
When you talk of times to come
When humanity is equal

And the bad Old Order’s gone.

I believe in your great vision,
Still, the tears in my eyes shine,
For even in the best New Order,
Darling, you will not be mine.

A Prayer

Teach me, teach me how

To deal with the world, O Lord!
And how I may transform

Evil into good.

If a wild beast lurks
In our humanity,

Let me turn it toward
A mild humility.

I’ve seen a trainer in

The circus tame a tiger;
Seen him de-fang a snake.
Lord, let me be wiser.

Bless me with patience, too,
And make me iron hard
That I may show mankind
At least such wonders, Lord.
