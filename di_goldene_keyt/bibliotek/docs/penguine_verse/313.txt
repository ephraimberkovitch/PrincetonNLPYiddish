1890, Grodno, now White Russiaâ€”1918, Grodno.

8 on poetry. He was a prolific translator of Euro-
pean verse, introducing playful and elegant themes into Yiddish.
From the appearance of his first book, Lyrics (1915), the more
refined Yiddish readers showed appreciation for the youthful,
cosmopolitan freshness of his work. He used untried formal

all of which led some critics to see his work as decadent. An early
heart ailment added urgency to his writing, combining intimations
of death with regret for the disintegrating traditional Jewish life.
