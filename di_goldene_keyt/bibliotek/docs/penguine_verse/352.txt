A stool set at the head of my bed.

A light. A book of Kulbak’s poems.
And drop after drop falls

poison and smiles onto a prayer book.

A little nap comes along.

I fly off somewhere. How light my world is.
No roof has weighed me down,

but chains threaten my fingers.

A strange bed. And opposite, an unfamiliar wall.
A window lights up and goes out.

Someone middle-aged there is looking for

a door, a raincoat, a pair of rubbers.

Everything swims away. Even my faith swims away
that once was as strong as heaven.

The melody of a prayer crumbles like sand,

as if children had sent it flying with a shovel.

And a fair takes to the road

and leaves behind it shattered panes, caps, dark weather,
and dusty routes

twisted by greed and smashing.

The clouds stretch into the blue,
in wind, in thirst, in sunny desires.
And at dawn a Jew in Brisk hauls
a last board, oaken, heavy.

A hole covered and a sign painted:

“Shoelaces and combs and matches and boards.”
Play it, barrel organ, again and again,

that same refrain.
