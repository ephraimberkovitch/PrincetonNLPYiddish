470 Jacob Glatstein

by the thousands,
then hide Your face.

The walls of our houses
drool gibberish.

We have yet to learn |
the ABCs

of holiness.

How many myriad lives must we seize
before our thoughts can earn

even the footstool of Your favor?

I pray from a tongue-tied page,

my woebegone God.

 

You do not terrify,

You have no malice.

Still You keep Your distance from us
who live in the profanation

of every moment.

The flash of eternity

in our nostrils

assures our ruin.

I pray from a tongue-tied Page,

my woebegone God.

Our Jewish Quarter

Not for nothing did we let them know
far and wide: We are God’s Elect.

Every Friday, with the dawn’s first glow,
a bit of manna fell and decked

our streets, though

not enough. No matter how cleverly,

 

manna: Each day on the desert journey from Egypt enough manna fell to sustain
the Jews until the next day.
