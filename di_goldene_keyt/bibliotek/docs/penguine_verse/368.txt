340 Yisroel Shtern

For the Curious

When someone asks me who I am,
I send that someone to my nights.

The first night says:
A grave.
No stone has yet been raised.
He flew about as quiet
as a dove,
and somewhere fell asleep
like a dove.
No one cried over him,
and no stone has been raised.
But sometimes while the world laments
somehow so softly
and as white
as a white dove,
the moon in the middle of the sky
stands still
and with a long finger points
toward the window of a little house:

he died here!

The second night replies:
Always in loveâ€”
once with a day that sailed away
in a ship of gold across the sea
and once with a day that cradles still
within my lap and sleeps its fill,
until in red-blue ink
God scrawls across the sky:
Wake up... wake up... wake up!

Always in love,

he could stand for hours

in the midst of the sleeping town
and burn and burn

between two suns.
