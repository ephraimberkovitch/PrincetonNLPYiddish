And anxiously awaiting

The noose. Swing me over.

Entering no plea for mercy, nor rueful
Of my hard appointed fate.

But O, my bright one, Reyzele,
Heed your mother-wit:
We live once—let it not rush past in vain.

Deer at the Red Sea

The sunset grew bold: it insisted on staying

In the Red Sea at night, when the innocent pink
Young fawns delicately make their way
Downhill to the palace of water to drink.

They leave their silken shadows on the shore,
Bending to lick the rings of coolness

In the Red Sea, with long fiddle-faces. And there
They are betrothed at last to the silence.

And then—they run away. Rosy flecks
Animate the sand. But the sunset deer
Stay behind in the water, mournful, and lick
The silence of those that are no longer there.
