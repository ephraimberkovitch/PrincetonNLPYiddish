Aba Shtoltsenberg

Cooks up millet and honey, brews mead,
slips me, going, pennies to buy cherries with.
Hail stings and clay clings,

who knows I'll get out of this alive?

Shadowy spies clutch poles of grape clusters.

A roaring drills the heart, hairs stand up.

This laughing lionâ€™ll flick me with his knotted tail.
Drowsing, open-eyed, on a sandy hill.

A summer of homing pigeons

shows me, from there, the way.

Here is the town beggar at our stoop.
Light and the pigeons worry our window.
