476 Jacob Glatstein

The neighbors are off to church.
Our draymen-in-disguise,

hosing down their wheels,

cut the stream to cut the noise.

Lost souls, they look for safekeeping
to the deserted synagogue

that waits to fill up on Yom Kippur.

These Sunday Jews are secret Jews
smiling for the neighbors.

The church bell tolerantly skips over
the doorposts of the Jews.

They listen

with pricked-up ear,

in Marrano fear.

Yom Kippur: the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, when even nominally
observant Jews attend the synagogue.

the doorposts of the Jews: an ironic reference to the story of Passover, which
commemorates the flight of the Jews from Egypt. Before the last of the ten
plagues, the Jews were invited to mark their doorposts so that the angel of
death would avoid their households when he went in search of the Egyptian
first-born sons.

Marranos: Jews in Christian Spain and Portugal from the late fourteenth
century onward who were forced by the Inquisition to convert to
Christianity but who continued to observe certain Jewish customs in secret.
