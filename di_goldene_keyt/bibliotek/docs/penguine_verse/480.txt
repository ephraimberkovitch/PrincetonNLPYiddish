Sometimes, it seems to me I have it all in my hand,
And all at once it is shrouded, concealed.

There’s much that puzzles me, Nathan. Do you understand?
I don’t want to put my mouth to my own ear.

We cast a drowsiness on the son of man;

He is shown the earth below

And a dreadful sky above.

But in between there’s something too.

I know . .. it’s called . . . it seems to me... living.
Somewhere, there’s a desiring woman pleased

By a man’s answer in warm secrecy.

But should it thus begin to move in me,

I’m overcome with fear, and I say:

See that thought . . . that scoundrel;

Beat hell out of it... attack... pursue.

Nathan, inscribe.

For example, consider the good instinct. A high-class relative,
a welcome guest,

A gourmand, his little belly well-pastured among good deeds.

But my pity’s for the instinct for lust.

Devout little Jews drive the poor thing, tooth and nail.

It fasts with them on fast days.

It faints for a spoonful of warm stew.

And what is the purpose of the instinct for lust?

Joy and the revelation of joy; consolation fermented of grief;

Grief twinned out of solitude—

Solitary generations of loss

Multiplied into eternity

Between heaven and earth.

What else, poor thing, is the instinct for lust:

Body. Flesh.

good and evil instincts: The yeytser toyv and the yeytser hore (the latter
usually associated with the sin of lust) are the two opposing forces that strug-
gle for domination of the human personality.
