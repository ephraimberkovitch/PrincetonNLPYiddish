 

124 Mani Leyb

Written in 1914, this poem was read as an aesthetic call for modulation
against the fervid oratory of the earlier Yiddish labor or sweatshop poets.
It invokes, also, the classic posture of the diaspora Jew, eternally poised in
expectation of the Messiah,

Hush

Hush and hush—no sound be heard.
Bow in grief but say no word.

Black as pain and white as death,
Hush and hush and hold your breath.

Heard by none and seen by none
Out of the dark night will he,
Riding on a snow-white steed,
To our house come quietly.

From the radiance of his face,
From his dress of shining white
Joy will shimmer and enfold;
Over us will fall his light.

Quieter—no sound be heard!

Bow in grief but say no word.

Black as pain and white as death,
Hush and hush and hold your breath.

If we have been mocked by them,
If we have been fooled again
And the long and weary night
We have waited all in vain,

We will bend down very low
To the hard floor, and then will
Stand more quiet than before,
Stiller, stiller and more still.
