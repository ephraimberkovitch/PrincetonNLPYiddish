SCHWARTZ

(Shvarts) 1885, Lithuania—1971, New York.

‎to New York in 1906 and worked as a teacher in the local‏ יפ
‎Hebrew schools. Between 1918 and 1928 he ran a large clothing‏
‎store in Lexington, Kentucky, and then returned to New York City.‏
‎Toward the end of his life he moved to Florida. Better educated and‏
‎more traditionally oriented than most of his colleagues among Di‏
‎Yunge, he translated classical and modern Hebrew poets, par-‏
‎ticularly Bialik, into Yiddish, as well as Shakespeare and Milton.‏
‎His epic poem Kentucky (1925), obviously inspired by his life in‏
‎the southern United States, was the first such sustained poetic nar-‏
‎rative in modern Yiddish literature. He also wrote, in addition to‏
‎lyrics and longer poems, a biographical narrative, Yunge yorn,‏
‎about growing up in the old country.‏
