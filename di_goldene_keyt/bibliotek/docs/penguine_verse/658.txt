630 Leyzer Volf

The theater offers farces.
He laughs and wipes his brow.
‘Let us,’ he smilingly answers,
‘forget the Jews for now.’

Well, so I grow silent.
I'll ask no questions here.
The theater offers farces.
I shed a secret tear.

Oh, my unfortunate brethren,

I am rich, it’s true,

but I weep because even a wormling
is far better off than you.

But do not worry, brethren,
it’s been known for ages past
the Messiah will be coming
to our ancient land at last.

And we shall be exalted

as well as prosperous,

like a rain of silent tears

sent down from heaven to us.

And in Jerusalem, brethren,
there will stand once again
a white, eternal Temple

in the sweet sun, Amen.”
