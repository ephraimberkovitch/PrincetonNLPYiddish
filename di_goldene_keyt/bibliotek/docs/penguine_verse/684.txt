Twenty Lines to a Tree

You smell of sweat, and murmur,
the last light in your branches.
Around us, birdtalk. I shiver
with passion for mating.

We have the same source.

My fingers are roots that dig

into the cool, dark, deep.

Our bark splits, yours and mine;
the sap presses; the book

on the ground is hoarse,

shouting through its shackles.
The book and J are planted, like you,
in dread, entangled

with rivers, earth and heat,
glowworms and night sounds.

All nests are warm with whispers.
The birds shiver awake.

My hands burn on your thighs.

I want you to know me:

I create a language for you.

Three Jewish Boys Write
to an Ancient Chinese Poet

Li-Tâ€™ai-Po, three Jewish boys
send greetings. They spoke
of your poem today at sunset
on the Warsaw Nalevki.

Strange light caressed

the cornices of ruined castles,

a coachman swayed on his carriage seat,
and students crowded the street of taverns.

Nalevki: the crowded Jewish street of Warsaw.
