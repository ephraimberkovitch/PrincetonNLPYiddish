are little known in the English-speaking countries are spelled
phonetically in accord with the transcription method of the YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research. (The transcription chart can be
found in Uriel Weinreich’s English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English
Dictionary or in the Index volume of the Encyclopedia Judaica.)
We deviated from the phonetic orthography, however, in the case
of American Yiddish writers, since it would have appeared odd to
assign phonetic spellings to writers who had established their
names in English. Their names appear, therefore, in their familiar
English spelling, followed by the phonetic variant in paren-
theses—e.g., Jacob Glatstein (Yankev Glatshteyn). In the case of
pseudonyms or names that have been altered, the original is given
in brackets—e.g., Melech Ravitch [Zekharye-Khone Bergner].

The transcription of Yiddish words in the English texts also fol-
lows the YIVO system. Since some of these words are known
according to their sound in modern Hebrew rather than in spo-
ken Yiddish, the Hebrew common transcription appears in
brackets—e.g., tales (Heb. tallith]: prayer shawl. But with a
number of familiar Jewish terms like rabbi, Torah, Yom Kippur, we
have followed the spelling of Webster's Third New International
Dictionary, even though it may not correspond to either the Yid-
dish or the Hebrew phonetic transcription.

Our aim throughout has been to make Yiddish poetry, in both
the original texts and the English translations, readily accessible to
the interested reader.
