And grass.
And stayed there alone.

The prayer of a poor man in hiding

Who pours out his heart to God.

O Lord, why is one so punished?

I am too much where I stand; and wherever I go I carry
The smell of darkness.

I envy the bird who has it better than us;

And I envy the soil that has it better than all.

What shall I do with my superfluous hand,

And with my heart which is superfluous too?

Leonard Wolf

Summer

Today, the world was unfurled once more and renewed.
The teeming earth, the whispering green, the swelling bud.
Everything shook, as the tense body of a virgin
Becoming a joyful wife might be shaken.

And I, like a cat, lay in the middle of a field

Where light spurted and glistened and glowed.

One eye smeared by the sun, the other eye shut;
Silently laughing, silently feeling delight.

Across fields and valleys and woods, mile after mile,
I ramble: gleaming and hard, like steel.
