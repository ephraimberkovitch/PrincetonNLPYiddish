348 Perets Markish

What is the world compared with the sacrificial altar toward
which I lead myself?
And what's eternity compared with my dying Now?

All I can see is scanty compared with my lack of desire;
And earth’s arid ground is skimpy for my heel.

What is female flesh set against my flaming desire?
And flaming desire compared with my idleness?

Leonard Wolf

Hey, women, spotted with typhus and riddled with rakes of
fingers

Across autumn heads of woe,

Are you fruitful? Do you multiply? How many times each?

In whorehouses? On floors?

In the stable? In train stations?

In culverts, like bitches?

How many times, each?

In a moment, a train, like a coffin, will go into the earth—

Up on the roof! Lift your feet, like smokestacks,

Tie your shirts to foamy skies

And breathe the hot street-corner midnights—

And from each of you let there be born—a Jesus

To be gobbled on feast days

And not for the gallows, and not for crucifixions.

Hey, whores of discarded children,
Beat it!

Suck your own udders...

Milk them; choke on them.

Gnaw them away

from the body’s gaunt walls—
Three echelons

Of swollen bastards—

No one knows where
