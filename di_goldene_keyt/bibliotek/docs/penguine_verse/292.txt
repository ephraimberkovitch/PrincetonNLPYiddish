 

264 Dovid Hofshteyn

The ship of my loneliness...

I rinsed her sails

In the winds . .

They dwindled and tore

In the lengths and breadths

OF the world.

In the wild flights

Of wasting simooms,

City!

I arrived in your harbor on the ship of my loneliness.

I tied

The ship of my loneliness

To iron rings

In your harbor.

On shore,

In countless taverns

I drank

Till I was drunk

The wines of the world.

On your constricting and concrete roads,
I learned not to limit my road,
To go endlessly on

Round and round,
Continually driven

And to feel

That a fifth one, a tenth one
Is driven,

Running in circles,

Each one at the center.

City!

On your constricted and concrete roads,
I learned to take risks,

To desire,

And, like everyone else,

To put my pitchers

Into the wells of the world;

To join my quiet breath
