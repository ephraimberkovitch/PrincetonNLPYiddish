This is one of fifteen prose poems of Green Aquarium, a sequence of
symbolic narratives that Sutzkever wrote in the 1950s of the Vilna Ghetto
and the resistance of Jewish partisans in the forest nearby.

Death of an Ox

With burning horns, two twisted candles under a radiant yellow
halo, an ox lunges from the flaming stable with a hoarse bellow, as
if the slaughterer’s gilded knife had remained stuck in its throat.
Purple rings rise like smoke from the dried manure on its backside,
and the flesh blazes along the forelegs as far up as the jaw like
kindled wildgrass.

The first snowfall—as if someone had chased a great flock of
baby doves from their warm sleep in heaven’s coop and forced
them to sinful earth—the snow cannot quench the fire. When the
sparks, darting red needles, stab the falling doves awake—quicker
than a sigh—the doves are swallowed up by the greedy fire. Fed by
the snow-doves, the fire rages exultantly, wildly, around the
victim, chaining the ox in copper ribs, riding its back like a naked
satyr and lashing it with fiery whips.

Its ears catch the sound of a distant mooing, a moo of terrible
yearning, a thunderclap with severed wings.

But it cannot answer. Its mouth is open butit has lost, really lost,
its tongue.

Its own momentum drives the ox forward, the fire rising from
the ground, from the dark sunken swamps that reach all the way to
a lake.

When the ox rushes into the lake up to its knees, and when its
reflected elliptical eyes, like molten glass of many colors, catch
sight of a second upside-down ox in the water with its burning
horns pointing downward to the sky, then a human smile begins to
wrinkle its face.

Its copper ribs burst.

The ox turns its head to the left, in the direction of its home
village, where only one dark chimney stands, like a dead hand, and
remains perfectly still.

For a while the horns flicker, like candles beside a dead man;
then they are snuffed out with the day.
