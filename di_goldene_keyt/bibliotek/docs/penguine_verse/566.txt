538 Aaron Zeitlin

To Be a Jew

Being a Jew means running forever to God
even if you are His betrayer,

means expecting to hear any day,

even if you are a nay sayer,

the blare of Messiah’s horn;

means, even if you wish to,
you cannot escape His snares,
you cannot cease to pray—
even after all the prayers,
even after all the “evens.”

1947 Robert Friend

Six Lines

I know that in this world no one needs me,
me, a word-beggar in the Jewish graveyard.
Who needs a poem, especially in Yiddish?

Only what is hopeless on this earth has beauty
and only the ephemeral is godly
and humility is the only true rebellion.

Robert Friend
