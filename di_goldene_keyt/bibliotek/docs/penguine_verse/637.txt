BERISH WEINSTEIN

(Vaynshteyn) 1905, Rzeszéw, then Galicia—1967,
New York.

aised in his grandmother’s house after his father fled to

America (to escape the draft), Weinstein was exposed to
refugee conditions in the First World War and during the Polish
pogroms. As a Polish citizen he lived illegally in Vienna, then came
to New York in 1925 and made his debut as a poet two years later.
The material density of his poems, reminiscent of Carl Sandburg,
their down-to-earth and sometimes coarse subjects, seemed to
fulfill the expectations of proletarian poetry that were current in
the late 1920s and 1930s. Sometimes overlooked was the narrative
power that is released through Weinstein’s stately lyrical forms.
