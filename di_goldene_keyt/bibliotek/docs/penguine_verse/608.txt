580 lisik Manger

Would that my soul might be as bright and clear
As the clarity of white-spread snow.

The night is bright; only the heart is dark

As it goes stumbling through the ripened white.
Tired and hushed, I say and hear the blue

Of your name. I say it to the night—

Your blue name to the whiteness of the night.

Leonard Wolf

The Besht, acronym for (Israel) Baal Shem Tov—literally, Master of the
Good Name—was the founder of the Hasidic movement. He is the subject
of hundreds of hagiographic tales attributing to him powers of mystical
concentration strong enough to affect the course of nature. Manger’s title
provokes recognition of the similarities between this Jewish figure and
certain mystics of the Christian tradition; it establishes his heretical
credentials in treating an otherwise unexceptional Hasidic motif. The
poem is dedicated to Manger’s brother Notte.

Saint Besht

Almost midnight. The Baal Shem sits
In his quiet alcove, lost in thought.
The night is holy, lovely, deep;
Even a man with barefoot step
Moving alone through a foreign land
Can feel himself in God’s blue hand.

The Baal Shem rises; then suddenly

There sounds at the window a tremulous cry.
“Who grieves at night; who is it weeps

When the bird, the wind, and the hut all sleep,
And the forest sleeps along with them?

Who drives the gold away from his dream?
Listen,” the Baal Shem says, and turns

To the exiled grief, “Come sleep in my hands.”
