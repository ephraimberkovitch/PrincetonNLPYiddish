I Walk Along

I walk along, absorbed in thoughts of bread,
When, from out of the blue, just up ahead,
One of the Just gives me a stare, and then
Asks if I wish a rooster, or a hen.

Let’s see: the hen lays eggs for Mankind’s sake,
The rooster’s crowing startles him awake.
But there’s a horse’s mouth I have to feed,
A cow to milk and soil to plow—I need,

In fact, the rooster, and I tell him so.

He touches me with his handerchief, and lo
And behold! a rooster made of gold jumps out—
The very kind I’d always dreamed about.
Under my arm I put him; off I go,

Like that, into the garden in the snow.
Meanwhile, I add up what I have: a red
Scarf, for one, the cap upon my head,
Galoshes, and a rooster made of gold.

I wonder what I still want—but I’m called
By a hurried, distant voice, 1 turn about:

A woman through a window reaches out

A flower to me, and I make it mine.

She asks me in, and orders up some wine
From someone kneeling, bowing to the ground
Until his forehead makes the floor resound;
He runs to fetch me milk and kasha—nu,
Kasha and milk was what I’d wanted, too.

I grab it, like the rooster made of gold
Under my other arm, and soon I've strolled
Farther into the garden in the snow.
Meanwhile, I add up what I have to show:
Galoshes, the cap upon my head as well,

A scarf, a rooster, a flower in my lapel,
And a bowl of milk and kasha on a tray.

of every generation, for whose sake God allows the world to remain in
existence.
