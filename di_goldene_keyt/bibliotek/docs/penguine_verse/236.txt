Runs after his hat in the wind so wild—
Hey and ho and hello, he shouts,

And the hat, wildly springing to and fro,
Doesn't hear, wildly springing to and fro,
Garden of snow, my garden of snow.

Whose fault is it that I’m foreign to you,

Garden of snow, my garden of snow?

Whose fault is it that I’m foreign to you

When my funny shawl and my cap appear

Like nothing that anyone else wears here,

When I still have a beard that the wind picks through
Like a woman through straw, for the egg below

For her sick child, a chicken’s egg below—

Garden of snow, my garden of snow.

John Hollander

Salute

There's always something in our land, too,
And when there’s no lamppost that will do,
There’s a convenient tree: what's clear’s
That a Black of at least twenty years

Hates anything tall that, in a pinch,

Would hold you high enough to lynch.
Although the one that I saw get

Hanged, wasn’t quite fifteen yet.

The white old maid has an unsweet face;
Like a rusty lock on an old suitcase

Were her nose and mouth, it must be said;
Feet? Hands? with such an old bag, instead
OF touching her skin, you're better dead.

She charged him: You're the one, she said,

Ul have you hanged until you're dead.

In his panic he laughed and befouled himself, true,
But she brought along tar, and she laughed too,
