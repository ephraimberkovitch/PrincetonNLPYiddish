 

118 Eliezer Shteynbarg

Louder, brighter.

A star is dancing on a platter.
Hallelujah! Somewhere there’s a chord
OF faith resounds.

Pssssst. A cherub’s just flown by
On a shimmering ray.

He finds the trilling

Thrilling

And gathers it all up

Into a cup

Of fire

And takes it higher, higher.

Sprawled, pleased,

Reb Porker Kosher-foot reposes,
Dozes.

A bourgeois at his ease.

Wheezing gentility,

Gets gracefully upon

His feet and belches, yawns,

Says “Snort”

And “Snort” again.

His many chins shake up and down.
“Hey,” says he, “my little nightingale!
The devil take your grandma.

Hey, tell me, where’d you learn

To sing like that?

Snort! Snort!

I haven’t had so fine

A belch in a long time.

Sing on,

You little bastard,

I'll not forget you.

Sing, sing on.

When you sing, my gut works to perfection;
Snort! Your music’s great for my digestion.”

Leonard Wolf
