 

366 Perets Markish

Pass on; pass on.
My head will not offer the Ark any respite,
Nor desert cattle drink at my heart.

“In thy blood live!
In thy blood live.”

It’s a milky night, like moon-flesh set in a pitcher.

Oh, black cats, don’t be afraid of my restless tapping—
I will utter the Sovereign Mound’s decree:

It flings the Ten Commandments back at Mount Sinai.

Its thirsty mouth, a swill of grief that seethes

With black marrow, fumes like a glowing crater.

Hey, markets and mountains, I call you to oath with my song.
The Mound spatters Mount Sinai’s Commandments with blood.

Two birds circle its mouth; they speak; they conjure.
From on high, they wind its tongue like a blazing scroll
And place on its brow a crown of frothing stars.

Ah, Mount Sinai! In the upturned bowl of sky, lick blue mud,

Humbly, humbly as a cat licks up its midnight prayers.

Into your face, the Sovereign Mound spits back the Ten
Commandments.

Leonard Wolf

“In thy blood live! In thy blood live!”; Ezekiel 16:6. Reviewing the history of
the nation in the form of an allegory, Ezekiel represents Israel as a female in-
fant, abandoned after birth in an open field. When God passes and sees her
wallowing in her blood, he says, ‘In thy blood live! In thy blood live!’ He
grants the child life despite its unclean, repellent appearance. The midrash
suggests that the repetition of the phrase refers to the blood of circumcision
and the blood of the paschal lamb, which the Jews shed in Egypt before the
Exodus, signifying that self-sacrifice ensures life. Markish depends on some
familiarity with the redemptive interpretation of this prophecy for its bitter
application here.
