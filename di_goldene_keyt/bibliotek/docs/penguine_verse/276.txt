This poem and the two that follow are part of a book of poems written
over a period of eleven years (1926—37), incorporating many elements of
the poet’s biography. They project a composite image of the Yiddish in-
tellectual—one Fabius Lind—in New York during this period, a figure or
persona of restlessness, experimentation, and self-irony, searching for
points of stability in life.

Fabius Lind’s Days

Fabius Lind’s days dribble away in blood.
Red ribbons of failure, emptying his veins.
Inside his head, turbid white stains. Confusion.
And his heart is heavily laden.

He would...

He would...

Great webs of gloom—

In his mind; before his eyes,

And some kind of bent bow that’s aimed
Right at the tip of his nose.

Fabius Lind, lost in thought,

In reading and wandering speech,

Tugs, in his bewilderment,

At the leash around his neck.

Why is it Fabius cannot ride

The coattails of the age?

Or find his place in the ranks

OF all the marchers?

Why can’t he take a fast trip there,

To the playground of his childhood
And bring the little whistles back

With which to whistle for himself

The song of soothing?

Why is he so indifferent at a funeral,
So nervous at a birth?

Why can’t he grab both whores, death and life,
And join them in a holy-foolish dance?

But whom does he ask, Fabius Lind?
