LEYB KVITKO

1890 or 1893, Alesskov, Ukraine—1952, place of death
unknown.

 

 

rphaned in childhood, Kvitko worked at manual jobs and

began writing “straight out of the air, not out of any school.’
In 1918 he moved to Kiev and became part of the group around the
magazine Eygns. He published his first book of lyrics, Steps, in
1919. During his sojourn in Germany (1921—25), he became an ac-
tive Communist and on his return to the Soviet Union participated
in many literary and cultural undertakings. His early work showed
expressionist tendencies, but as a result of ideological pressure he
cultivated a strong “folk voice” in later years. His children’s verses
were sung, taught in the Yiddish schools, and translated into
Ukrainian. In 1929, after criticizing some Jewish cultural
authorities, he was ostracized and his work was not published for a
number of years. Later ‘‘reinstated,” he was active in the Anti-
Fascist Committee during the Second World War. Arrested early in
1949, he was executed on August 12, 1952, with other leading
Jewish writers.
