540 Aaron Zeitlin

Zeitlin wrote many poems about Warsaw, recalling landmarks and per-
sonalities like this peddler of the Nalevkes—Nalevki Street (it no longer
exists)—the heart of the Jewish district, crowded with shops and
hawkers.

Ten Groschen

Growing gray by a gate
an old man stands—
an image of sorrow,
small and extinguished.
I still hear the cry

that weeps in my ear:

Ten groschen, ten groschen—
the Nalevki Street blizzard
forever in motion

swirling around him,

while he stands there and sells
his ten-groschen calendars.
Hey, Jews, a calendar—

your guide to the holy days.
Stop! What's the rush?
Come buy a calendar,

one little calendar,

to give you some notion

in all this commotion

of just where you stand—
before, God forbid,

you fall underfoot

or are crushed by a cart.

This is not what he utters—
that withered, extinguished
little old man.

I hear it all in the words

of his wintry beseeching:
Ten groschen, ten groschen!
