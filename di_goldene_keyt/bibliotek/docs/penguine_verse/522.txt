494 Uri Tsvi Greenberg

Nor did there appear one Jew to redeem that wretched body
from Turkish hands, to cover with a tales
that folk-mocked Messiah—to cover him and flee.

How great then is the distance between Istanbul and Jaffa? He
could have placed the dead man on a raft,

entrusted all to the current (just as the Jews once trusted
Lithuanian waters),

with birds following after,

and like the waves beneath them, the clouds rolling above them—

that for cortége for a dead man on a raft, a folk-derided Messiah.

But there was no such Jew in Turkey.

Nor can any man in these parts realize

with what a shout of joy King Shabtai Tsvi descended

into the fire of hell, his own fire!
