ZISHE LANDAU
1889, Plotsk, Poland—1937, New York.

D tion of spiritual refinement into a personal ideal of aesthetic
perfectibility. Arriving in New York in 1906, he became associated
with Di Yunge as their leading exponent of “pure” poetry, free of
rhetoric and collective themes. He undercut early romantic idealism
by self-mockery, irony, and deflationary effects. Later, resisting
the disintegrative pressure of immigrant life, he celebrated the joy
of the commonplace, the harmonious clarity of everyday ex-
perience. Landau also translated English ballads, Russian sym-
bolists, and German lyricists, and wrote charming poetic dramas
combining old-world Jewish subjects with characters and motifs of
the European stage.
