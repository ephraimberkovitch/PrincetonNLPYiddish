 

Itsik Fefer

I’m a quiet guy and hardly a villain;
My honesty has no great appeal;
I’m never known to put on ¢filn,
I’m never known to wheel and deal.

So what if I’ve been circumcised

With rituals, as among the Jews?

Field winds have tanned my middle-sized,
Pale, dreaming feet to darker hues.

John Hollander

Raised in the heartland of the Hasidic movement in the Ukraine, Fefer
delights in transposing its joyous energy to his own political cause. Reb
Itsikl (Isaac Twersky of the Chernobyl dynasty) had been the rabbi of
Skvira, not far from Fefer’s birthplace, Shpole.

I’ve Never Been Lost

In all my short, happy life, I’ve never
Been lost, nor forgotten the way I came.
I laugh to myself when I remember
That I carry some famous rabbi’s name.

The name that my grandfather wanted for me
Was the Holy Reb Itsikl of Skvira’s,

That I might lay tfiln and wear a tales

And do my singing of prayers and zmires,

That I might be the richest man in town,
And my wife’s housekeeping be the best,

tfiln: phylacteries, worn by men.
tales: prayer shawl.
zmires: Sabbath melodies.
