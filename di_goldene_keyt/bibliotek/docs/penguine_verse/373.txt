PERETS MARKISH

1895, Polonnoye, Ukraine—1952, place of death
unknown.

rafted into the tsarist army in 1916 and wounded on the

German front, Markish welcomed the Russian Revolution as
a break with the past that would also usher in an explosive new
movement in Yiddish poetry. He was briefly associated with the
Eygns group in Kiev, but in 1921 he went to Warsaw, where he
stepped into the foreground of modern literature as one of the poet
editors of the expressionist Khaliastre magazine. His startling
imagery, expressive diction, devil-may-care attitudes, and ex-
travagant projection of the untrammeled ‘I’ made him the symbol
of the new cultural freedom. During the years of his emigration,
Markish also lived briefly in western Europe and visited Palestine,
returning to the Soviet Union in 1926. One of the most prolific and
celebrated of Soviet Yiddish writers, he wrote poems and novels of
epic sweep on themes of Jewish national decline and regeneration.
He was awarded the Lenin Order in 1939 and was active in the
Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee during the Second World War. He
was arrested in 1949 and executed with other Soviet Yiddish
writers on August 12, 1952.
