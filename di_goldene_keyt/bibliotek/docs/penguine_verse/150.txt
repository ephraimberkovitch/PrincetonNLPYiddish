What's to be done?

What makes you think I know?
Unless a groan

Will help, or else a sigh.

That’s something, anyway,
Pure sympathy

That comes from loyalty.”

“Rarrroarrr!” Out and in the lion thunder rolls.

The mouse, scared more than half to death,

Takes to her heels,

And scoots back

To her hole where she lies sick

(May God preserve you from the like)

With a pain in her side for a whole week;

Then binds her children and their children

With a solemn oath:

“When trouble overtakes a lion, in whatever fashion,
Damned be the mouse that shows the lion compassion.”
