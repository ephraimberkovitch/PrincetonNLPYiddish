Household of Eight

Household of eight.
Beds are two.
When it gets late,
What do they do?

Three with father,
Three with mother:
Limbs

Over each other.

When it’s night

And they go to bed,
Mother begins

To wish she were dead.

A resting place

All her own.
Narrow—

But you sleep alone.

Warsaw, 1899
Nathan Halper

What Have I to Do With

What have I to do with music, child?
The only hum in my house was the wild
Wind in the chimney, the hungry cry
OF children and mother’s curses in reply.

What have I to do with beauty, child?

I went past gentiles and dogs to the field,
Through streets that were desolate and poor,
And a foothill of dung stood at every door.

Leonard Wolf
