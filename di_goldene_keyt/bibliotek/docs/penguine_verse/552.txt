524 Rokhl Korn

my brown body falls at your feet,
a stalk breaking before the harvester.

Seymour Levitan

On the Other Side of the Poem

On the other side of the poem there is an orchard,
and in the orchard, a house with a roof of straw,
and three pine trees,

three watchmen who never speak, standing guard.

On the other side of the poem there is a bird,
yellow brown with a red breast,

and every winter he returns

and hangs like a bud in the naked bush.

On the other side of the poem there is a path
as thin as a hairline cut,
and someone lost in time
is treading the path barefoot, without a sound.

On the other side of the poem amazing things may happen,
even on this overcast day,

this wounded hour

that breathes its fevered longing in the windowpane.

On the other side of the poem my mother may appear

and stand in the doorway for a while lost in thought

and then call me home as she used to call me home long ago:
Enough play, Rokh!. Don’t you see it’s night?
