568 Itsik Manger

Based on Genesis 29:9 ff., Manger’s Jacob displays the airs of a Western-
educated Jew who lords it over his small-town relatives back home. He
converses with Rachel in affected Germanized Yiddish, with touches of
French thrown in for good measure.

The Patriarch Jacob Meets Rachel

It’s late in the evening. Bedraggled,

The patriarch plods his way.

“There is the well—the one to the left. . .
That's it... certainly.”

He checks his pocket Bible . .
It’s clearly written, “There.”

In that case, what’s the matter?
Why isn’t the girl here?

She comes. The pitcher in her hand,
She runs. “Ah, what a girl.”

More lovely than the Bible says—
Indeed, a perfect jewel.

“Bon soir, my pretty mademoiselle.

I am an étranger,

That is... perhaps... vous comprenez,
I mean... I’m not from here.

However, Miss, I’m said to have

An uncle hereabouts.

It may be he’s well known to you. .
Vous comprenez, no doubt.

His name is Lavun... c’est 4 dire,
He’s not just anyone.

He’s said to be a millionaire

By all the folks back home.”

“Laban Harami happens to be
No one but my papa...”
