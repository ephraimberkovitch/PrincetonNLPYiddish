GABRIEL PREIL
(Prayl) 1911, Dorpat (now Tartu), Estonia

abriel Preil immigrated to the United States with his mother in

1922,.soon after the death of his father. He attended for a time
the Teachers Institute of the Rabbi Itzkhak Elkhanan Yeshiva and
Yeshiva University, but basically he educated himself on his own,
as an avid reader in several languages. Preil began writing poetry
almost simultaneously in Yiddish (1935) and Hebrew (1936). He
came into close relation with the In Zikh group of Yiddish poets,
especially its leading figure Jacob Glatstein, and the impact of its
esthetic would be felt in much of his later work. He published
several Hebrew volumes before putting out his first book of Yid-
dish poems in 1966. In the last few decades he has been considered
a major Hebrew poet, acclaimed in the Israeli literary world. His
spare, understated style and his Familiarity with both the American
landscape and American poetry have brought a new flavor into
both Yiddish and Hebrew poetry.
