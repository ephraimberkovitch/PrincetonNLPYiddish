670 Abraham Sutzkever

Dated 1936, but later revised, this poem became part of the larger cycle of
poems entitled Sibir (Siberia).

In the Hamlet

1

Sunset over icy blue roads. Sweet sleepy
Colors suffuse my mood. A little hut
Shines across the way in the valley,
Covered with a flurry of sunset.

Amazing forests sway against the panes;
Magic sleighs go ringing by.

Doves coo in the attic, coo my face
Out of its shell. Beneath the ice,

Striped with flashes of lightning crystals,
The Irtysh ripples as if it were not real.
And there, under the hushed cupolas,

A seven-year-old child—a world—grows tall.

2

In the luminous, bleak, snowy

Siberian hamlet where I lived as a child,
Flowers spring from the dark-eyed shadows,
Innumerable, quicksilver, wild.

Into the quenched corners of the room,
The moon breathes its solitary brilliance.
My father’s face is white as the moon,
The snow’s silence weighs upon his hands.

He slices the black bread with the bright
Merciful knife. His face grows blue and old.

And I, with my fresh-sliced thoughts,
Dip my father’s bread into the salt.

Irtysh: the Irtysh River, which flows through the Siberian city of Omsk.
