keeping at it till they ended with a spirited,
“Old Josh has a head on his shoulders.”

By the time he built his life’s edifice,

there were iron-gray streaks in his hair;

his face was burnt brick-red,

with deep wrinkles around a strong mouth
that smiled in hidden certainty.

In his house and yard were

slim, athletic sons

and slender puritanical daughters

in their white dresses, with long braids

and clean-cut, tanned faces.

Though by now they were estranged

from the old ways.

Even he grew away from it all,

indifferent to faith.

Give the devil a finger,

he'll want the whole hand;

Josh skipped praying one morning, then another,
till he gave it up entirely.

He was closed on the Sabbath,

but it didn’t do a bit of good.

He didn’t rest or read a holy book;

his head tugged at him and carried him off,
and the bigger his business grew,

the more burden the Sabbath.

He would catch himself totting up accounts
on the Sabbath and be ashamed,

then directly be lost in business again.

The only one who sighed over this

was his tall, thin wife.

She still made shabes holy,

blessed the candles, read the women’s prayers,
longed for the old ways.

shabes (Heb. shabat): the Sabbath.
