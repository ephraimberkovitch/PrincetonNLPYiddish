438 Jacob Glatstein

Mozart

I dreamt that the goyim
crucified Mozart

and dug him a donkey's grave.
It was only the Jews

who made him a God-Man,
and kept his memory

blessed.

 

His apostle, I ran through the world
converting everyone in sight.

I snatched proselytes

all over; Christians for Mozart.

Marvel

at the Testament of Music
of the Man Divine:

his song-nailed hands
shine.

Crucified singer,

how his fingers go after
laughter

in deepest affliction.
Through dooms of tears
more than himself he loves
his neighbor's ears.

The Sermon on the Mount:
how stark,

how bereft,

when you count

what Mozart left.
