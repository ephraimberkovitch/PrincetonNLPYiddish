if I do not take all time and space in me,

Moses Montefiore (1784-1885), philanthropist and champion of the
Jews, became a popular hero among the Jewish masses and later, a subject
of song and legend, as an intercessor with the political authorities. He
traveled and brought assistance to many Jewish communities, including
Vilna. This mock ballad assesses the great benefactor somewhat less
reverently than do the folk songs.

Montefiore in Vilna

Brothers, blessed in number
(may no Evil Eye look down),
they say that Montefiore

will be riding through the town.

They say that he has a palace,
pure gold, pure gold all through.
They say he could buy up Russia
if only he wanted to.

They say that he sits with the Kaiser
at chess and eats his figs.

They say that he’s built a suke
covered with silver twigs.

They say that he’s a devil,

they say he’s a holy man,

that he buys up Jews from the Kaiser
by the dozen when he can.

suke (Heb. succah): the booth in which Jews take their meals during the Feast

of Tabernacles.
