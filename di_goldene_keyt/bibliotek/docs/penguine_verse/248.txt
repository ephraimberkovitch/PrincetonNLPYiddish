You are distant

as the thud of armies in the streets

heard from within a still, dreamy house;

as silhouettes in remote alleys

glimpsed through a golden haze of lamplight.
Yet something in the gesture, the stride,
reminds me that in some strange way

these things are familiar.

Dear monsters, be patient.

Because night is coming, and the heart,
sick from an old guilt,

defenseless, alone,

hears the approach of footsteps,

hears and waits, without resisting.
Now you are here! The room dissolves,
as I sink, an untrained swimmer,

about to be trampled and broken.

You are terrible, yet vague.

You loom up around me like mountains,
howl blindly at my sides like giant hounds,
and murmur with me dully and madly

the tales of an old, old guilt.

And the heart, a stray sheep,
cries itself to sickly sleep.
