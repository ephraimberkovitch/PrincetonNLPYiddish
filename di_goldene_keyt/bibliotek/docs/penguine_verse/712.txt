Abraham Sutzkever

This man could be a god, and I a worm.
All the same I roar at my tormentor:
You have no right.

That I die, in witness, arm across my chest,
Is nothing.

But that a slave should be master of my years—
This, to me, is gall.

Inscribed on the slat of a railway car:

Should you happen on a string of pearls,
Threaded on a length of blood-red silk,

Which, like the pathway of life, runs all the finer
As it nears the throat,

Until, dissolved in fog,

It vanishes from sight—

Know, these pearls you’ve found
Once coolly lit my heart,

The reckless eighteen-year-old heart
Of a Paris showgirl named Marie.

I, transported through chartless Poland,
Now fling them through the grate.

If you are a man,

Deck your sweetheart with your find.
Wear them, if a girl,

The pearls are yours.

And if old—let them form

The object of your prayers.
