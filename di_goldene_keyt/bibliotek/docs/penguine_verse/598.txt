50 1151 Manger

“Then Mademoiselle, unless I’m wrong,
You are my cousin Ra—”

“And you are Jacob, mon cousin.’
Sne blushes by the well,

While Jacob, in his secret heart
Thinks, God, she’s beautiful.

Each takes the other by the hand.
A cooling evening wind

Swirls them in a firm embrace
One moment and is gone.

Leonard Wolf

Based on the story of Joseph, Genesis 37-50, “The Selling of Joseph”
became in Europe a popular subject of Purim plays, performed during the
celebrations commemorating the victory of Esther and Mordecai over
Haman, The title of the poem draws attention to Manger’s anachronistic
transposition of Jacob into an east European father, studying the weekly
portion of the Bible with his sons as a good Jew would have done. His an-
ticipation of Joseph’s trials is an added piece of playfulness: a well-known
midrash explains that Joseph was able to resist Potiphar’s wife because
“the image of his father brought him to his senses and his illicit passion
departed from him.” (Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, II, 54).

Jacob Studies “The Selling of Joseph”
with His Sons

“Why do you stand so silent,
Reuben, my oldest son?”
“Our Purim play, dear father,
Is ready to begin.”

“Come, put on your silken shirt,
Joseph, my best-loved son.
