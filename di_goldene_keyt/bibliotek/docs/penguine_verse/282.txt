 

254 Aaron Glants-Leyeles

And you, straight-nosed and mystic-eyed,
Run on your thin (indeed, too thin) feet,
And announce my poetic fame in all
Four corners,

And all four sub-corners.

Whether calm or resting,

Whether fed or fasting,

Dressed, or in your olive nakedness,
Speak my greatness to the world.

It is high time.

Those wicked folk, my enemies,

Are busy taking pains

To erase from memory

Across the stars, across the seas,

The trace in poetland

Of its prince of princes.

It’s reaching the provinces now.

Leonard Wolf

Leyeles was deeply affected by the appearance between 1909 and 1927 of
the Yiddish translation of the Bible by the poet Yehoash (Solomon
Bloomgarten, 1872-1927). This is one of his many poems on biblical
motifs.

Isaiah and Homer

Homer’s grace is unparalleled; it is Homer’s!
The dignity, the full, childlike desire;

The manly power, and the sublime heroics—
But even more rare is Isaiah!

Homer—a wide pool, flowing and yet profound:
He bathes Aegean shores in the sun’s high fire,

Or strokes the ear with moonlight’s silver vespers.
But the water of life is Isaiah.
