ELIEZER
SHTEYNBARG

1880, Lipkany, Bessarabia—1932, Czernowitz, then
Rumania.

hteynbarg, a dedicated teacher in the Jewish secular schools of

Rumania and briefly in Rio de Janeiro, was the author of
children’s texts, poems, and plays. The most imaginative fabulist
in modern Yiddish literature, he transformed the popular genre
into a sophisticated form of dramatic poetry. Like his younger
compatriot, Itsik Manger, he combined traditional and modern
imagery and language to achieve witty, socially penetrating effects.
The apparent folkishness of the fables does not obscure his in-
novative rhythms and artistic use of the spoken idiom: he was one
of the most exacting craftsmen in Yiddish poetry, honing his
poems for years before permitting their publication.
