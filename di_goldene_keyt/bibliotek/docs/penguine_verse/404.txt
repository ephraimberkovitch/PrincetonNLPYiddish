376 Perets Markish

A blizzard rages from the River Bug

And wipes out footsteps with a lash of snow,
But on the bent menorahs of Bialystok,
They’ve hung their exile up—like violins.

Leonard Wolf

Written sometime between 1940 and 1943, this first appeared as section 3
of a sequence, entitled Ho lakhmo (This Is the Bread), a reference to the
invocation ‘This is the Bread of Affliction,” which launches the Pass-
over Haggadah recitation. The phrase “mirror on a stone” from the first
stanza has been used as the title of the major anthology of Soviet Yiddish
literature.

[ Shards]

Now, when my vision turns in on itself,

My shocked eyes open, all their members see
My heart has fallen like a mirror on

A stone and shatters, ringing, into splinters.

Certainly, not every shard is free

To testify about me till my last four destined ells,
But don’t you trample on me, Time, my judge,
Till I’ve recovered from the breakage all the bits.

Piece by piece, I'll try to gather them

To make them whole with stabbed and bleeding fingers.
And yet, however skillfully they’re glued,

My crippled, broken image will be seen.

In the midst of grief, at last I solve the problem;
In the pain of molten glass, flaming, I see

The self’s need to be whole inside the mirror
Which, in the shards, was sown to the seven seas.

Leonard Wolf
