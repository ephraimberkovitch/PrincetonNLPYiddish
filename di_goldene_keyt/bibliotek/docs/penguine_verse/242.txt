He is, after all, a brother,

And you shouldn’t be cross with him

For not scraping up the scalp as well.

He only does what he’s told and when he’s paid for it.
And the death-smock, as well,

That, too, was sewn up by a hungry brother.

And if a child of the very poorest

Dolled up in good clothes for a holiday

Can allow itself to be led everywhere by the hand,

You, too, may allow yourself to be led to the electric chair
No matter how old you are.

And if the murderous copper gleams on your head

What can still be too hard?

A king—even when the whole kingdom wails around his throne—
Should be silent at his coronation.

And if, elected, his crown is one of fire,

It is a crown of wonder in this desolate world;

And only the wolf, who ranges forever because of his wildness,
And only the thief in the night,

Are afraid of fire.

Infants, speechless, who cannot yet

See anything with open eyes,

Reach out toward fire.

And only the butterfly that longs for the light

In the night’s darkness

Welcomes forever with outstretched wings

His fiery death.
