314 Melech Ravitch

Sit down at my feet, little fool,
rest your head on my lap, my son.
The whole thing was only a dream,
and now the dream is gone.

Take these seven groschen instead;
buy a fresh apple and feel,

biting into the flesh,

the meaning of the real.

And help me to light the lamp
and see that the stove is lit,
and take off your shoes

from your tired feet, and sit.

And get rid of the thoughts in your head,
the buzz, buzz, buzz of ideas,

and toss from your shoulders at last

the burden of years.

And lie down in that cot again,

your childhood cot, my dear.

See, hereâ€™s a screen in front of the lamp
to protect your eyes from the glare.

Ephraim, you must be tired.

So go to sleep as well,

and J shall croon our child a song
that has this tale to tell:

Once there was a story.

Hardly happy, it could not sing,
and the story had its beginning
with a Jewish singer, a king.

Over seven continents and oceans
he wandered in every weather,
finally returning

to his old mother and father.
