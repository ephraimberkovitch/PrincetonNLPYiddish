King Jesus stammers, ‘’O wretch, I believe
Your dust is more holy, more holy your grief.”

From the crucifix trickles a thin, silver cry;
Smiling, the verminous man turns away

With heavy step toward the evening town
For a loaf of bread and a pitcher of wine.

Leonard Wolf

In the Train

The train is hounded, like an exile’s heart.

In the fields, a harvest of white snow.

Red eyes glisten, glow, and are extinguished,
But brighter, clearer is the field of snow.

All roads are bright; only the heart is dark

As it goes stumbling through the ripened white.
Tired and hushed, I say and hear the blue

Of your name. I say it to the night—

Your blue name to the whiteness of the night.

When the train is hounded, then its spark
Flies back, as if it had been turned to longing
That wavered, searching for the right way back,
Only to perish in an infant's cry.

Every moment that you’re nearer,

All my yearning’s crucified on wind;

It waves about, like dangling spider’s thread
Enclosing everything my sorrows spun

Long ago, and all I then conceived.

Now, you are all I know, and the white night.
Now, you are all I know, and the white night.

The train is hounded, like an exile’s heart.
In the fields, there blossoms the white snow.
