And you being young, would turn them on
(Of beauties there’d be more than a few)—
When someone’s stuck with an old husband
A nice young footman seems quite her due,
And when one person has nothing at all
Then someone else has no need of two.

But even I, who am older already,

I, too, would be better off there, somehow.

I wouldn’t hang about like a sick man
Whom no place ever would allow

To enter; there’d be no bedbugs to creep
Over body and head, as in where I live now.

The landlady here is an animal:

She ignores the house, which looks like hell,
And her boyfriend comes and throws you out
When in the darkness, you let out a yell—
Named Alphonse, he wears a yellow topper
And a rose there in his right lapel.

In Central Park

Whose fault is it that your tree can’t be seen,
Garden of snow, my garden of snow?

Whose fault is it that your tree can’t be seen
When the woman strolling through you displays
A bosom that rises and falls in the ways

That a boat on the ocean will toss and careen
Over troubled waves, with twin pirates, yo-ho,
Who cry out that they are twin pirates, yo-ho!
Garden of snow, my garden of snow.

Whose fault is it that there’s no stag hereabouts,
Garden of snow, my garden of snow?

Whose fault is it that there’s no stag hereabouts
When a priest, who should be as devout as a child
