614 Berish Weinstein

Though over stretches of windblown fields idols mourn railroad
thieves’ sins,

The prayers the thieves make are not false; once they pray, their
prayers are true.

Leonard Wolf

This poem is a response to Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor of Ger-
many and the beginning of his rule of terror.

Executioners

The rushing ax cools and bleeds; the ax drips,

And necks, at its edge, split and rebound;

The gash at the gleaming cut is dimmed with steam;
And blood drains swiftly away from the cold steel.

In prison cells, bodies are branded with dark blue swellings.
Clothes fall apart beneath the flaying switch

And under a cold sweat, bellies quiver.

Wounds drain and congeal to raw meat.

To keep its fine edge, the ax is thrust in the ground

So it will shine when it’s held to the spurting sun;

Held over white sifted sands, over freshly planed boards

On which the newly shaved heads, their eyes wide open,

Their necks cleanly washed, and warmly unbuttoned, will bounce.

The wound of decapitation’s extinguished in sand;

Teeth clench the lips; the still living temples throb.

Through its covering cloth, the body continues to breathe.
Sometimes, a foot or a hand tries to live; the fingers, watching, die.
