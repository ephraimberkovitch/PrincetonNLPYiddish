breathed life into me
and drew near:
a seething horizon to a field.

The Filth of Your Suspicion

You cover my words, my deeds,
with the filth of your suspicion.
Your glances taunt me.

Frogs leap from my mouth.
Worms slide from my fingers.

I have the eyes of a hideous witch.
My hands are snakes

that uncoil to choke you;

but my shy feet,

glued to earth,

fail to escape

your mocking eyes.

Like Snow on the Alps

Like snow on the Alps,
sharp as mountain air,
like heady old balms,
your beauty calls.

Because you dazzle, like new snow,
your thin air stifles breath. ‘
My head spins

from a bitter magical fragrance.

Still, you’re just a small-town boy

with a longish nose.

You will slip a ring on your bride’s finger,
and grass will grow over me.
