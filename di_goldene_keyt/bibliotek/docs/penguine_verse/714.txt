 

Abraham Sutzkever

Hangman, beware. Your every savagery
Is aimed against you, tenfold.

Even here, in this oven hell,

My burning soul is not consumed.

Curling from chimneys, a cloud of black,

I will come swarming, gliding on your trail,
Obliterating trace and spore,

Your serpent in his cradle, your domain.

In an orchard, amid the fruit trees,

On the drawbeam of a well,

A scratching:

Here lie those not present

When village folk were in the synagogue,
Being burned.

With the well-rope,

He who blindly writes these words
Has hoisted from this grave of waters
Himself and child.

Now he but desires

To return below.

Survivors! Inherit, with your happiness,

The tears of each of us, flickering in that vise.
Remember: Inhale our dying.

Never forget: Be martyrs to life.

To you, the rescue of a Jewish child
Is a crime.

So let me herewith confess:
Guilty, guilty,
