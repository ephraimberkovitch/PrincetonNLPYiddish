With silent steps, he makes his way
Home to his hut of brick and clay.
Seating himself beside the sill

He waits for the birds’ first morning trill.
He waits for the first drop of the sun. .

Before the day from dawn can rise,
Softly, to himself, he says:

“The cry of the earthworm or the hare,
The cry of a blade of grass or star

Can shake the world into alarm.
Father! Keep them safe from harm.”

Then, to his hand a sundrop falls
And downward to his garment rolls.

An infected wind weeps in our garden;

Before our house a scarlet lantern glows;
Death’s silver razors play, like fiddle bows,
White music on the throats of pious calves.

In the nursery, cradles rock themselves

And mother’s gone—her chaste, still music dies,
A guiltless sacrifice of lullabies.

November: young and slender brides are weeping,
“Where art thou, loveliest and golden one?’
But pimps glide to their windows to peer in,
