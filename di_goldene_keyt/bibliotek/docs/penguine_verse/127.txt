JOSEPH ROLNIK

(Yoysef Rolnik) 1879, Zhukhovitz, White Russiaâ€”
1955, New York.

fter an earlier visit to America, Rolnik settled permanently in

New York in 1906 and was the first of the American Yiddish
poets to refine a body of verse evocative of Old Country memories
and landscapes. Somewhat older than the nucleus of Di Yunge, he
shared their preference for natural diction, sparse imagery, and
simple themes of wholly personal expression.
