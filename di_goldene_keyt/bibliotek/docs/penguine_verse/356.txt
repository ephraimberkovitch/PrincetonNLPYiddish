White Night

White night, my painful joy,

your light is brighter than the dawn.

A white ship is sailing from East Broadway
where I see no sail by day.

A quiet star hands me a ticket
open for all the seas.

I put on my time-worn jacket
and entrust myself to the night.

Where are you taking me, ship?
Who charted us on this course?
The hieroglyphs of the map escape me,
and the arrows of your compass.

I am the one who sees and does not see.

I go along on your deck of secrets,

squeeze shut my baggage on the wreath of sorrows
from all my plucked-out homes.

 

—Pack in all my blackened pots,

their split lids, the chipped crockeries,

pack in my chaos with its gold-encrusted buttons
since chaos will always be in fashion.

—Pack the letter stamped Unknown at This Address—
vanished addresses that sear my eyes,

postmarked with more than years and days;

sucked into my bones and marrow.

—Pack up my shadow that weighs more than my body,
that comes along with its endless exhortations.
Weekdays or holidays, time of flowers or withering,
my shadow is with me, muttering its troubles.

Find me a place of honey cakes and sweetness
where angels and children picnic together
