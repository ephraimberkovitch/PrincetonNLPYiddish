Izi Kharik

Often, it seems to me I stand at

your border; and it seems to me that you
Would rather not be bowed and that your huts
Like round-eyed, newly wakened sheep

Want to start up from their summer sleep.

Shtetl, shtetl of my long-gone childhood.

There was a time I wished to see you burning,
But he who cursed you once upon a time

Must learn to know that you have been accursed,
shtetl, shtetl of my long-gone childhood.

1926 Leonard Wolf
