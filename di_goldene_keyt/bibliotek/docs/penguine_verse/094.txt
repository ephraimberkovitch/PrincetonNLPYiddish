“but wait.

A good set of teeth can crack it.
Victory’s sweet.
Warm up the spit,
the meat

will come on its own
and she flew with the wind
and was gone.

יו

Tantivy-tan-ton!
What transpires?
Did somebody

see the Messiah?

When is the shoyfer blown?
Elul, not Tamuz.

Has he gone crazy,

the shames?

The rise and fall,

of the trumpet call,

whipcrack!

the wheels go round,

and a coach

rolls into town!

Trumpet blare

and whipsnap!

mouths drop open, people stare:
“What's up?”

What's up?

A German’s come from Danzig.
And he’s dealing in wheat, dealing in rye.

shoyfer (Heb. shofar): ram’s horn blown daily during the Jewish month of
Elul, preceding the high holidays.

Elul, Tamuz: months of the Jewish year corresponding to September, July.

shames: sexton.
