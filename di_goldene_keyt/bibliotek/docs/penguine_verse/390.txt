Perets Markish

Fluttering ribbons, beads,
Buttons and tubs

At fairs and marketplaces
Seethe.

At Sunday market stalls,

Joy flickers on all faces;

Each wagon heaped to the skies with wares,

Peddlers dance while dickering.

It’s Yom Kippur’s-end. Quickly. A ducat more or less.
Beggars on banduras pray for all,

And with false yardsticks measure

Ripped Torah parchments scrap by scrap.

“Hey, ribbons, beads, buttons and tubs!
use them in good health.”

An idiot pig, somewhere in a culvert,
Wets the holy Ten Commandments

As on a piece of smeared and foaming rag.

From the heights, mouths like sheaves
Reach up to withered udders—
Clouded, sealed.

Will heaven yield a drop?

And skies, like blue tin teapots bent,
Or naked bakers bending.
Will they trickle at least once?

With hairs curled like twisted wires,
A jostled wheel quarrels.
Will there be the slightest puff of wind?

And sunsets chew the cud of trodden grass
Like tiny bones of childish hands.
Will there be no wondrous sign at last?
