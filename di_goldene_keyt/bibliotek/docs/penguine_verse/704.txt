676 Abraham Sutzkever

How?

How will you fill your goblet

On the day of liberation? And with what?
Are you prepared, in your joy, to endure
The dark keening you have heard

Where skulls of days glitter

In a bottomless pit?

You will search for a key to fit

Your jammed locks. You will bite

The sidewalks like bread,

Thinking: It used to be better.

And time will gnaw at you like a cricket
Caught in a fist.

Then your memory will resemble

An ancient buried town.

And your estranged eyes will burrow down
Like a mole, a mole. . .

Vilna Ghetto,
