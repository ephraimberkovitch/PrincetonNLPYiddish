Published in Lvov in 1921, and revised for its second edition (Warsaw,
1922), the long poem—about 1,700 lines—of which this forms a part, was
the first full-bodied work of Greenberg’s Expressionist period of the
1920s.

From Mephisto

Why is it then that early-spring blue is so deeply distressed?
Why at the sight of the lilac does a tear well up in the eye?
Why do the wedding nights of the brides grow sad?

And when the band plays, why are the bridegrooms pale?

Why does a dark grief gnaw on evenings of blessedness,
when the world’s dearest—your wife, trembles on the bed
and covers you with her hair?

Why does the heart then heave?

Why is the song of a rain-filled night sorrowful?

And the odors of a field—why do they make you sad?
Why does the peace of a village draw you to loneliness,
and the ripe reds of an orchard

becloud your thirsty eye?

There must be someone surely, someone not God,
who rests in the blue, wafts fragrance from lilacs,
and breathes from the walls in sadness,

someone who cries out from every play of hands
in the house of joy.

And there must be someone, surely, who blows

a nightmare through the heart of repose,

so that it seems: somebody’s standing there

and listening, somebody sees . . .

and through the imagination wings a baleful crow.

Copperlight-time, midday, the soup is like a pond.
Flies come to drink from my plate as from a stream,
