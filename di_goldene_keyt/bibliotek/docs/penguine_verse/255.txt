H. LEIVICK

(Leyvik Halpern) 1888, Ihumin, White Russia~1962,
New York.

 

 

rrested in 1906 for illegal revolutionary activity on behalf of

the Jewish socialist Bund, Leivick was sentenced to hard labor
and life exile. He escaped from Siberia in 1913 and fled to America.
Though initially attracted to Di Yunge (he inverted his given and
family names when he was confused with Moyshe-Leyb Halpern),
he identified his own experience of incarceration with the Jewish
trauma of persecution, lending national resonance to personal
themes. The theme of spiritual endurance triumphing over
physical suffering was reinforced in his work after repeated bouts
of tuberculosis that required long periods of hospitalization. He
was deeply affected by the mounting anti-Semitism in Europe that
culminated in the destruction of European Jewry. On these sub-
jects he wrote dramatic poems and poetic dramas as well as lyrics.
His most famous play, The Golem (1920), is one of his many works
exploring the Messianic motif in Jewish history and consciousness.
