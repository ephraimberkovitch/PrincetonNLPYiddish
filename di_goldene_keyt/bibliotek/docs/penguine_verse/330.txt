This is part of a long narrative poem on Spinoza, the dominant
philosophic influence on Ravitch’s life. The Jewish philosopher Baruch

all over Jewish Amsterdam;

the Jewish wives and daughters, their heads covered
with black silk kerchiefs, come out of their houses
and fill the streets with ominous waiting.

From the depths of the fog a beadle’s voice cries:

Then a silence, broken only by the three loud raps
of a wooden hammer.

And here’s a woman shouting up to the window above her,
“Solomon, Solomon, for God’s sake, hurry,

or we'll be late for synagogue and we'll miss
Spinoza’s come-uppance!””

The forlorn Jewish district seems suddenly lonelier,
its streets are as empty as on Yom Kippur,

black candles are being lit, there is shouting

and lamentation, all is confusion—
