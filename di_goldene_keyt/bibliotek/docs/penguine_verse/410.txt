In her direction; but she, wringing her hands, cries out,
“There’s a man out there, ignored at the end of all distance,
Behind him . . . behind him, the earth is like fog... .”

He stole away there himself,

And unlocked the shackles of time.

Now he hears the cold, precise,

Grimly mournful eternal voice...
In all—

The carousers are numbed by vague fear;

Mute shape by mute shape, they sit in the silent half-dark
In which the woman wrings her hands as she weeps.

Her gleaming pale eyes turn darker; they glow

Like fireflies in withering grass—

Then some fellow kisses her:
A man with a rubber nose.

A Ball...

Mene, mene, tekel upharsin

Brilliantly lighted halis resound,

And the orchestra mourns.

Drums muffle the deep grieving of fiddles.

The basses, like old grave-makers, dig their dark shovels.

The clarinets laugh;
The cymbals chatter—
The brass platters yell...

And gentlemen in stiff coats
Dance with white-silken ladies.
Bright,

Brighter,

And brighter . .

The prefatory epigram “Mene, mene, tekel upharsin,” from Daniel 5:25—28, is
the source of the phrase, “the handwriting on the wall.” During Belshazzar’s
feast, Daniel warns the king that if he does not humble himself before the
Lord of Heaven, his kingdom will be conquered and destroyed.
