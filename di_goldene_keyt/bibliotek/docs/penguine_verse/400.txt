 

372 Perets Markish

Dated Safed, 1922, this poem was written during a trip to Palestine.

Galilee

Mountains after mountains, road upon road scramble

And cling. They unload the day from their necks

To beg, and to make confessions. Wheels roll me to Arab
markets

In the valley. Spirals pour me out on the dust heaps of fairs.

Where is the land of the sunny specters?

Where’s the road gone? Where has it disappeared?
Galilean hills, and the rocky havens of Safed—
Where Jerusalem winds arrive at night.

Lead me, day, as my heart is led by sorrow!
Lead me, lead me through tattooed green fields,
We'll tarry nowhere along the way.

On your feet! A tiny donkey, sadder than fate;
A wild mix of wild Bedouins,
Or a camel in love on its way, Jerusalem, toward you.

Safed, 1922 Leonard Wolf

I recall: beside some rivulet, lonely shepherds arrange their
fires.

There is no pasture, but cattle drowsily chew their cud.

There, black windows in white huts—the dusking twilight,

And I don’t know whose horn it is that sounds the call to rest.

In the village, hasty bells ring this white Sunday in,

Twilight creeps out of ownerless wells;

On the far side of the river, on the Bolshevik Russian border,
The wind-whipped songs of soldiers fade with the day.
