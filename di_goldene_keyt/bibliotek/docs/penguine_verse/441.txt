YANKEV-YITSKHOK
SEGAL

1896, Solobkovtsy, Ukraine—1954, Montreal.

hortly after his arrival in Montreal in 1911, Segal became an

active contributor to local Yiddish publications and helped
initiate several little magazines. Except for a five-year stay in New
York (1923—28), he taught in Jewish schools in Montreal and wrote
for the local daily, the Keneder Odler. His lyrics are filled with
close observation of everyday reality and finely etched memories of
childhood and youth.
